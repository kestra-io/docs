For too long, orchestration has meant **complexity and patchwork**: fragile schedulers, vendor lock-in, homegrown scripts, endless configs, stacked monitoring layers. Some even ended up coding their workflows directly in Python as if orchestration itself needed to be coded. The result: **slow to build, painful to maintain, impossible to scale.**

We introduced the first **declarative orchestration**, giving engineers a new path: **simple, transparent, powerful.** Instead of writing imperative code to describe *how to run a workflow*, you **declare the target state,** the tasks, their dependencies, conditions, and triggers. Kestra takes care of the rest: execution, scaling, retries, observability, and governance.

As the world turns to AI, orchestration faces a new inflection point. The stakes are higher, as the rapid pace of AI leads to workflows that are more dynamic and often unpredictable. But the answer hasn’t changed: **declarative orchestration is the foundation.**

## Already trusted worldwide

Kestra already powers **billions of workflows** for some of the world’s largest organizations, from **Apple to Toyota, Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom, BHP, and many other Fortune 500 companies**.

- **Fila** runs 2.5M workflows every month with just 25 engineers.
- **Acxiom** orchestrates for more than 50 enterprise clients and hundreds of teams.
- **Leroy Merlin** scaled from dozens to thousands of workflows in just weeks, growing data volume **9x.**

With more than **20,000 GitHub stars**, Kestra has become the **fastest-growing open-source orchestrator of its generation.**

And with **:PluginCount plugins available out of the box**, Kestra connects across the enterprise stack from data and AI to IT and business automation, allowing engineers to orchestrate everything, everywhere.

We are backed by the founders of **Datadog, Hugging Face, dbt Labs, Talend, Airbyte, Algolia**… and integrated with the platforms that already shape enterprise ecosystems: **Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp**, and many more.

Across industries, leaders choose Kestra because it delivers what others can’t: **stability, governance, and speed.**

## Why is Declarative the Only Way

AI is transforming how developers and organizations build. But without orchestration, AI would remain limited to chatbots.

Declarative orchestration means you define *what should happen,* and it always runs reliably and at scale with no lock-in or guesswork. This approach will be the backbone of how developers worldwide harness AI to build better, faster, and safer workflows.

Legacy orchestration cannot keep up. **Declarative is the only foundation strong enough for the AI era.**

## September 9: a new chapter

On **September 9, 2025**, we will officially unveil **Kestra 1.0,** our most stable, mature, and enterprise-ready release yet… but also one that introduces **breakthrough innovations orchestration has never seen before.**

We have built the foundation for the next decade of orchestration.

- **Stable:** tested across billions of executions.
- **Mature:** proven by the world’s largest enterprises.
- **Declarative:** simple to define, predictable to run, easy to scale.
- **AI-powered:** built to orchestrate workflows that are increasingly dynamic and intelligent.
- **Extensible:**  powered by :PluginCount plugins to integrate with everything that matters.

The countdown is on. In 7 days, we’ll reveal what will **permanently redefine orchestration.**
