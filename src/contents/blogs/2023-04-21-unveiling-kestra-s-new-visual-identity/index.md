As we unveil our new branding, we aim to showcase the sophistication and innovation behind our product, while maintaining a visual identity that is both intuitive and captivating. In this blog post, we will explore the story behind [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra)'s logo, typography, and design elements, delving into the meaning and message they convey. Join us on this journey as we reveal the essence of our brand and how it reflects our dedication to providing the best data orchestration solution for all of our users.

## The Story Behind Kestra's Logo and the Message It Conveys

When we created Kestra, our ambition was to design a simple yet powerful and fast data orchestration platform. We wanted to enable our clients to manage complex data flows with the same ease as a conductor who leads a complex symphony. This is how our logo was born, which embodies our tool and its ability to orchestrate multiple tasks simultaneously.

## The Logo and Its Components

The Electric Pink dot located in the pictogram represents Kestra, our data orchestrator. The six diamonds facing it symbolize the different tasks of the workflow and the data software plugins that Kestra manages with ease, just like a conductor who directs each musician with precision. Together, they execute a complex musical score, orchestrated with skill.

The Electric Pink dot and the triangle formed by the six diamonds represent an upward arrow, a UP, symbolizing the improvement that Kestra brings to IT organizations. Indeed, thanks to our data orchestration platform, our clients can improve their performance and optimize their workflows.

## Typography and Typeface

The name "Kestra" is written in lowercase and stylized in the Alliance Typeface font to reflect technological innovation, open-source, and scalable technologies. We added a new Electric Pink dot at the end of our product name, reminiscent of the Kestra orchestrator in the pictogram, but also to subtly evoke the expression "Kestra, period!", symbolizing the uniqueness of Kestra and its guarantee to be the best orchestration solution for all our users' needs.

## The Message Behind the Logo

The goal of the Kestra logo is to captivate attention, affirm our modernity and ambition, while subtly suggesting our pride, talent, reliability, and performance.

## Evoking a Sense of Harmony and Precision

The combination of colors, shapes, and typography in our logo and branding materials reflects our dedication to creating a user-friendly, intuitive platform that empowers data professionals to orchestrate their workflows with ease and precision.

## A Modern and Ambitious Design
