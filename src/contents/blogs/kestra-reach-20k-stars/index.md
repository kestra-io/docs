We've just hit **20,000 stars on GitHub**.

It’s a big number. But what it means to us is simple: people care about Kestra, and they’re using it. You believe in what we’re building, together.

Kestra started with a clear idea: **Orchestration should be simple.**

No one should have to wrestle with layers of infrastructure just to run their first workflow.
It shouldn't be something reserved for those who can write perfect Python or set up DAGs from scratch.

**It definitely shouldn’t get in the way.**

Orchestration should let you focus on your logic, process, and use case, not on maintaining a platform. And it needs to work for everyone, whether you’re running scripts, moving data, calling APIs, or automating internal ops.

## We didn’t take shortcuts
We didn’t grow on buzzwords. We took the long road, making sure things worked, scaling with real users, and building the foundations right.
And most importantly, we did it **in the open**. Every feature. Every bugfix. Every idea, shared, discussed, shipped.

**The community around Kestra is what makes this milestone possible.**
You tested early versions, challenged assumptions, built plugins, reported edge cases, gave feedback, and sometimes just came to say “Hi”.

Those stars? They come from you.
And for that, we want to thank you.

## What’s next
We’ve got a lot coming soon.

Yes, **1.0 is around the corner**, and it brings some of the biggest changes we’ve made so far.
New features, better ergonomics, and a battle-tested developer experience.

But the direction stays the same:
- Keep the platform open and flexible.
- Make orchestration accessible to everyone.
- Give teams one place to automate all their workflows.

Thanks for being part of it.
Let’s keep going! 🚀
