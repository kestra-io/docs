Install Kestra using the method that fits your environment.

You can deploy Kestra from a laptop or on-prem server to a distributed cluster in a public cloud. Some plugins such as the [Script plugin](../16.scripts/index.mdx) require Docker-in-Docker (DinD), which is not supported in some environments like AWS Fargate. For production, use Kubernetes or a virtual machine.

The easiest way to install Kestra locally is to use [Docker](./02.docker/index.md).
