Task Runners is an extensible, pluggable system capable of executing your tasks in arbitrary remote environments.

## Offload and isolate compute with task runners

Many data processing tasks are **computationally intensive** and require a lot of resources (_such as CPU, GPU, and memory_). Instead of provisioning always-on servers, Task Runners can execute your code on **dynamically provisioned compute instances** in the cloud, such as AWS ECS Fargate, Azure Batch, Google Batch, auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters, and more.

All you have to do to offload your task execution to a remote environment is to specify the `taskRunner` type in your task configuration. Each `type` of a task runner is a **plugin** with its own schema. The built-in code editor provides documentation, autocompletion, and syntax validation for all task runner plugin properties to ensure correctness, standardization, and consistency.

:::alert{type="info"}
Note that some task runner plugins are available only in the [Enterprise Edition](../07.enterprise/index.mdx). If you want to try them out, please [reach out](/demo).
See [Open Source vs Enterprise](../oss-vs-paid/index.md) to compare editions.
