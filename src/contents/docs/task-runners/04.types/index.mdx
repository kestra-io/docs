This section lists all task runners available in Kestra.

Each `taskRunner` is identified by its `type`. The [Process](./01.process-task-runner/index.md) and [Docker](./02.docker-task-runner/index.md) task runners are fully open-source and located within the [Kestra repository](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra). By default, Kestra runs all script tasks using the Docker task runner.
