Customer acknowledges and hereby authorizes that (a) Kestra’s Affiliates may be appointed as Sub-processors; and (b) Kestra and Kestra’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. A list of Kestra current Authorized Sub-Processors (the “List of Sub-processors”) will be made available to Customer, either attached hereto, via email or through another means made available to Customer. The List of Sub-processors may be updated by Kestra from time to time. Kestra may provide and set a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Authorized Sub-Processors and Customer agrees to subscribe to such notifications where available. Customer acknowledges that sub-processors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a sub-processor may prevent Kestra from offering certain Services to Customer.

    2. Notification of New Sub-processors. Kestra shall provide details of any new Sub-processor at least thirty (30) days prior to any such change with the details regarding the Sub-processors appointed.

In such event, the Parties shall discuss commercially reasonable alternative solutions in good faith. If the parties cannot reach a resolution, Kestra will either (i) not use, appoint, or replace the Sub-processor with respect to Customer or (ii) if clause (i) is not possible, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Kestra without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Kestra. Kestra will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) following the effective date of termination under clause (ii) in the preceding sentence with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer. If Customer does not object to the appointment of a new sub-processor within thirty (30) days after being provided the details from Kestra, the appointment or replacement of the relevant sub-processor shall be deemed approved by the Customer.
    4. Liability for Sub-processors. Kestra shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Kestra would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this DPA, except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement.
2. **RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS.**
    1. Data Subject Request. If Kestra receives a data subject request, Kestra will not respond directly to the data subject and will instead direct the data subject to directly contact the Customer.

For the purposes of Transfers of Personal Data under this DPA, the Customer and Kestra incorporate, to the extent applicable, the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses as if set out in full in this DPA (the “Data Transfer Agreement”) and pursuant to which the Client, for its own part and on behalf of each Controller, acts as “data exporter” and Kestra, itself and/or through any authorized Sub-Processor outside the EEA, acts as “data importer” (as those terms are defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). The signing and dating of this DPA by the Parties shall be deemed to be the signing and dating of the Data Transfer Agreement (the Customer signing as data exporter and Kestra signing as data importer). The terms of the relevant Data Transfer Agreements, if any, shall prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent terms of this DPA to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency. on its own behalf and acting on behalf of each controller of the DPA established in the EEA.

The Data Processor especially agrees to take all necessary precautions with respect to the nature of the Data and the risks encountered by its processing in order to preserve the security of the Data files and especially the prevention of any corruption, alteration, damage, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure and/or access by any unauthorized third parties.

In particular, the Data Processor agrees to ensure total separation between the Data Controller’s Data and the Data Processor’s other clients via a reasonable and physical or logical separation.

The means implemented by the Data Processor for ensuring the security and confidentiality of the Data especially includes the following measures:

- the encryption of Personal Data
- the means of ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
- the means of restoring access and availability of Personal Data within the appropriate/defined time limits in the event of a physical or technological mishap
- a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure safe processing

The Data Processor agrees to maintain these measures throughout the entire Agreement period and to immediately inform the Data Controller of any failures that may impact the Data Controller’s Data.

In all cases, when any of the methods for ensuring the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data and files are changed, the Data Processor agrees to replace them with superior methods. No change shall lead to a lessening of the security level.
