# Kestra & VMware Aria Automation (vRealize)
Kestra is an open-source workflow orchestrator and a compelling alternative to VMware’s orchestration suite (VMware Aria Automation, formerly vRealize Automation, now part of VMware Cloud Foundation). While VMware’s automation tools have become increasingly expensive and restrictive, Kestra offers a cost-effective, flexible solution with cutting-edge features. Aria Automation is only sold as part of the Cloud Foundation bundle – eliminating standalone or SaaS options – and many customers have seen drastic price increases as a result. In contrast, Kestra’s open-source model has no licensing fees and avoids vendor lock-in altogether.

The Aria Automation SaaS is now discontinued, and little new functionality has been added beyond rebranding. These pain points are driving DevOps teams to explore Kestra as a modern, open alternative that delivers better automation benefits without the drawbacks.

### Why Teams Replace VMware with Kestra
Organizations facing these challenges are turning to Kestra, which addresses the core pain points through a fundamentally different approach. Here’s why many teams are replacing VMware’s automation stack with **Kestra**:

- **Open-Source & Cost Savings**: Kestra is Apache 2.0 licensed open source, meaning no licensing fees or per-CPU costs. This dramatically lowers TCO compared to VMware’s proprietary platform, which now only comes as an expensive bundle. (Some VMware customers have even been hit with 10×–15× price quotes) By adopting Kestra, companies avoid these massive price hikes and costly renewals.
- **Declarative YAML Workflows**: Kestra defines workflows in a pure declarative YAML format, treating automation as code. This makes it easy to version-control and reuse workflows (GitOps-friendly) and improves readability. VMware Aria, on the other hand, often requires a mix of YAML blueprints plus imperative scripts or manual configurations to accomplish tasks. Kestra’s code-first approach improves pipeline maintenance and is more developer-friendly than VMware’s script-heavy automation.
- **Event-Driven Orchestration**: Kestra is inherently event-driven – workflows can trigger on external events, API calls, message queues, or schedules for real-time automation. This enables responsive, asynchronous processing (e.g. reacting to CI/CD events or data streams). VMware Aria Automation’s usage is primarily request- or schedule-based with more limited external event support. Kestra’s native event triggers let you build reactive DevOps processes (such as auto-scaling, incident response, etc.) that VMware’s tools struggle to match out-of-the-box.
- **Broad Integration & Vendor-Neutral**: Kestra has a broad plugin ecosystem and an API-first, vendor-neutral design. It integrates with virtually any technology stack – Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD tools, configuration management (Ansible), IaC provisioning (Terraform), ITSM systems (ServiceNow), databases, cloud services, and more. Kestra doesn’t favor any particular cloud or vendor, avoiding lock-in. In contrast, VMware Aria is deeply tied to the VMware ecosystem (vSphere, NSX, vSAN) with relatively limited support for non-VMware tools. Extending VMware’s automation to work across diverse platforms often requires custom scripting or additional products, whereas Kestra connects to everything out-of-the-box.
- **Faster Deployment & Easier Maintenance**: Kestra can be up and running in minutes on your infrastructure of choice – deployable via Docker, Kubernetes, or Helm with a lightweight footprint. Its simple setup means lower operational overhead and faster time to value. VMware’s automation suite, by comparison, is known for high complexity and deployment overhead – installs and upgrades often span weeks and may require professional services assistance. Notably, Broadcom ended the vRealize/Aria SaaS service, forcing customers back to complex on-premises deployments. Kestra’s ease of installation and management (no special appliances or lengthy configuration needed) lets teams start automating quickly without the headaches.
- **Scalability & Multi-Tenancy**: Kestra is cloud-native and built to scale horizontally. Its distributed architecture (with technologies like Kafka under the hood) supports running thousands of workflows per hour across nodes, and it includes multi-tenant namespace isolation for different teams or customers. VMware Aria Automation is typically a single-tenant, monolithic deployment per environment – scaling to new teams or use cases often means standing up additional separate instances, since it lacks true multi-tenancy. In short, Kestra can handle large-scale enterprise workloads and serve multiple teams from one platform, whereas VMware’s solution can become unwieldy at scale.
