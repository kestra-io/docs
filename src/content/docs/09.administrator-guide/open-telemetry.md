**Observability** refers to understanding a system's internal state by analyzing its outputs. In software, this means examining telemetry data—such as traces, metrics, and logs—to gain insights into system behavior.

**OpenTelemetry** is a vendor-neutral, tool-agnostic framework and toolkit for creating and managing telemetry data.
It helps implement observability in software applications.

OpenTelemetry defines three different kinds of telemetry data:
- **Traces** provide a high-level view of what happens when a request is made to an application. A trace can contain multiple [spans](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans).
- **Metrics** are measurements of a service captured at runtime.
- **Logs** are timestamped text records, either structured (recommended) or unstructured, with optional metadata.

Starting with version 0.21, Kestra supports all three kinds of telemetry data thanks to OpenTelemetry-compatible exporters. For more details, check out the [OpenTelemetry official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/).

## Traces

:::alert{type="info"}
Exporting trace data in Kestra is currently a Beta feature.
:::

The first step is to enable distributed traces inside the [Kestra configuration](../configuration/index.md) file:

```yaml
kestra:
  traces:
    root: DEFAULT  # Enable traces inside Kestra flow executions
otel:
  traces:
    exporter: otlp # Only otlp is supported for now
  exporter:
    otlp:
      endpoint: http://localhost:4317 # Replace with the address of your own collector
```

When enabled, Kestra instruments:
- All calls to its API
- All flow executions (one span per task execution, plus one span for each execution message processed by the Executor)
- External HTTP calls made by the HTTP tasks (including tasks that use the Kestra HTTP client)

### Trace correlation
Kestra propagates the trace context so that traces are correlated:
- The API call trace correlates with the execution it creates.
- Flow execution traces correlate with parent flows when the `Subflow` or `ForEachItem` task is used.
- External HTTP calls include the standard propagation header for downstream correlation.

### Example: Jaeger with Docker Compose

Enable [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), an OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing platform, with Kestra in a Docker Compose configuration file:

```yaml
services:
  # Postgres is included here as a dependency for Kestra during local testing
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14.13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: kestra_unit
      POSTGRES_USER: kestra
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: k3str4
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    restart: on-failure

  jaeger-all-in-one:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    ports:
      - "16686:16686"  # Jaeger UI
      - "14268:14268"  # OpenTracing (optional)
      - "4317:4317"    # OTLP gRPC receiver
      - "4318:4318"    # OTLP HTTP receiver
      - "14250:14250"  # External otel-collector (optional)
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    restart: on-failure
```

The following screenshot shows three correlated traces:

- One created from the API call that creates the execution
- One created from an execution of a flow named `opentelemetry_parent` which has spans for tasks including a `Subflow`
- One created from the `opentelemetry_basic` flow execution

### Disabling traces

You can disable traces for flows while keeping API traces:

```yaml
kestra:
  traces:
    root: DISABLED
```

You can also disable traces per component (experimental). For example, disabling only Executor spans:

```yaml
kestra:
  traces:
    root: DEFAULT
    categories:
      io.kestra.core.runners.Executor: DISABLED
```

#### Supported categories

| Category                               | Description                                       |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `io.kestra.core.runners.Executor`      | Spans for each message in the execution queue     |
| `io.kestra.core.runners.Worker`        | Spans for each runnable task execution            |
| `io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow`   | Spans for each `Subflow` task execution           |
| `io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEachItem` | Spans for each `ForEachItem` task execution     |

## Metrics

To send metrics to an OpenTelemetry-compatible collector, add the following parameters to your [Kestra configuration](../configuration/index.md) file:

```yaml
micronaut:
  metrics:
    export:
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        url: http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics # Replace with your collector URL
```

For example, you can configure an OpenTelemetry Collector to forward metrics to Prometheus:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:9464"
```

## Logs

To send logs to an OpenTelemetry-compatible collector, use the [LogShipper](../06.enterprise/02.governance/logshipper.md) with the built-in OpenTelemetry log exporter.
:::alert{type="warning"}
LogShipper is only available in the Kestra **Enterprise Edition**.
:::

The following flow sends logs from all flows to a collector daily:

```yaml
id: log_shipper
namespace: company.team

triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"

tasks:
  - id: log_export
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.core.log.LogShipper
    logExporters:
      - id: OTLPLogExporter
        type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.opentelemetry.LogExporter
        otlpEndpoint: http://localhost:4318/v1/logs # Replace with your collector URL
```
