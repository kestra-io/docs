## How to upgrade Kestra

To upgrade Kestra, follow these steps:
1. Perform a database backup (optional but recommended).
2. Read the [release notes](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases) to understand the changes in the new version.
3. Perform a rolling upgrade of Kestra components. For Kubernetes, upgrade the Kestra Helm chart as described in “Rolling upgrades in Kubernetes,” below.
4. Apply any actions noted in the release notes (for example, update configuration files or adjust deprecated features).

## How to rollback Kestra to a previous version

Sometimes you might need to roll back Kestra to a previous version. Follow these steps:

1. Perform a database backup (optional but recommended).
2. Stop all Kestra components.
3. Restore from a backup.
4. Restart with the older version.

Check the [Backup and Restore](./backup-and-restore.md) section for more information on how to backup and restore Kestra, and [Maintenance Mode](../06.enterprise/05.instance/maintenance-mode.md) to pause your Kestra instance for maintenance, upgrade, and backup tasks.

:::alert{type="warning"}
We strongly recommend avoiding downgrades. To prevent surprises, test the new version in a non-production environment before upgrading. If you must roll back, closely follow the steps above.

## Where you can find the release changelog

You can find the changelog on the main repository’s [Releases](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases) page. It lists changes, new features, and bug fixes for each release, as well as any breaking changes. For a high-level overview, see the release [blog posts](/blogs).

## How to identify breaking changes in a release

In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, the release notes include a `Breaking Changes` section. It lists changes that may require adjustments to your code or Kestra configuration, with links to [migration docs](../11.migration-guide/index.md).

:::alert{type="warning"}
The `Breaking Changes` section appears at the end of the [release notes](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases). Review it before upgrading.

## How to minimize downtime when updating Kestra

If you run Kestra as separate components, you should:

- Stop the executors and the scheduler
- Stop the workers — a graceful shutdown waits for active jobs to finish. The default is `kestra.server.terminateGracePeriod = '5m'`, configurable in your [Kestra configuration](../configuration/index.md).
- If the job finishes within five minutes, the worker shuts down immediately. Otherwise, the task is killed and restarts when the worker restarts.
- Stop the webserver (and the indexer if using EE with Kafka).

All components support graceful shutdown, so no data is lost. Afterward, update and restart everything in the opposite order (or in any order, as components are independent).

:::alert{type="info"}
The webserver hosts the API, so stop and then start it immediately to avoid downtime. After that, restart the other components so flow executions can resume.

## How to stick to a specific Kestra version

If you want to stick to a specific Kestra version, you can pin the [Docker image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra/tags) to a specific release. Here are some examples:

- `kestra/kestra:v0.21.4-no-plugins` includes the 0.21.4 release with the fourth patch version
- `kestra/kestra:v0.21.4` includes the 0.21.4 release with all plugins
- `kestra/kestra:v0.19.0-no-plugins` includes the 0.19 release without any plugins
- `kestra/kestra:v0.19.0` includes the 0.19 release with all plugins.

You can also create a custom image with your own plugins and dependencies, as explained in the [Docker installation](../02.installation/02.docker.md).

## Migrating a standalone installation

If you use a manual standalone installation with Java, you can download the Kestra binary for a specific version from the Assets menu of a specific [Release](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases) page. The image below shows how you can download the binary for the 0.14.1 release.

![download_kestra_binary](assets/docs/administrator-guide/download_kestra_binary.png)

Once you’ve downloaded the binary, start Kestra with the following command:

```bash
./kestra-VERSION server standalone
```

## Migrating an installation with Docker

If you use Docker, change the [Docker image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra/tags) to the desired version and restart the container(s) or Kubernetes pod(s).

### Docker Compose

If you use Docker Compose, update your compose file to the desired [Docker image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra/tags) and run `docker-compose up -d` to restart the container(s).

## Migration in Kubernetes using Helm

If you use Helm, set the [Helm chart `image.tag` value](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/3fb8eda4f71bd9128669a550b8cc56a82b3068aa/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L18) to the desired version. For example:

```bash
helm upgrade kestra kestra/kestra --set image.tag=v1.0.0
```

For more complex configurations that include multiple changes, consider using a custom values file:
1. First, create a `values.yaml` file that contains the settings you want to adjust.
2. Then, use the `helm upgrade` command with the `-f` flag to specify your custom values file:

```sh
helm upgrade kestra kestra/kestra -f values.yaml
```

## Rolling upgrades in Kubernetes

Upgrading Kestra on Kubernetes depends on your deployment rollout strategy. Every service can be rolled out without downtime, except workers, which need special attention.

During rollout, each component creates a new pod (the old one keeps running). After the new pod passes health checks, Kubernetes shuts down the previous pod, resulting in zero downtime.

Upgrading workers is more involved because they handle data-processing tasks that can run from seconds to hours. Define the desired behavior for in-flight tasks.

By default, Kestra workers wait for all task runs to complete before shutting down during a migration. You can override this behavior if needed. Kestra [Helm charts](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/3fb8eda4f71bd9128669a550b8cc56a82b3068aa/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L98) provide a configuration of a `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (set to 60 seconds by default) that allows you to define the amount of time you want to wait before force-killing the worker.

If the worker has no running tasks, or finishes them before the grace period, it shuts down immediately. If the pod cannot finish tasks before `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, Kubernetes kills the pod, and those tasks are resubmitted to another worker.

If a worker exits unexpectedly, the executor detects it and resubmits unfinished task runs to a new worker. The same behavior applies when a pod is terminated at `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.

## Where can I find migration guides

The [Migrations section](../11.migration-guide/index.md) details deprecated features and explains how to migrate to the new behavior.

For all breaking changes, the migration guides are linked in the [release notes](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases).

## Database Migrations

There are two types of database migrations: automatic and manual.

### Automatic database migration

Kestra uses [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to automatically perform database migrations when the server starts. Flyway version-controls schema changes and stores the current version in the `flyway_schema_history` table. On startup, it compares the current version with the target and runs any required migrations—no manual intervention needed.

### Manual database migration

Sometimes a manual database migration is useful, especially when you have a large database and you want to perform the migration before upgrading Kestra to avoid a long downtime.

For example, when migrating from v0.12.0 to v0.13.0, all indexes are rebuilt due to multi-tenancy (`tenant_id` is added to most tables). With a large JDBC-backed database, this can take hours. In such cases, run `kestra sys database migrate` manually before starting Kestra.

This command should use the same configuration as configured on your Kestra instance. Depending on whether you deploy Kestra using Docker or Kubernetes, this command can be launched via a `docker exec` or a `kubectl exec` command.

There are two ways to initiate the manual database migration:
1. Keep Kestra running in an old version. Then, stop Kestra and launch the command on the new version.
2. Start Kestra on the new version with automatic schema migration disabled: `flyway.datasources.postgres.enabled=false` (if your database is not Postgres, replace `postgres` with your DB type). Then run: `kestra sys database migrate`.

Example: run the command via `docker exec`:

```bash
docker exec your_container_id bash ./kestra sys database migrate --help
```

Here is the output of that `--help` command:

```bash
Usage: kestra sys database migrate [-hVv] [--internal-log] [-c=<config>]
                                   [-l=<logLevel>] [-p=<pluginsPath>]
Force database schema migration.
Kestra uses Flyway to manage database schema evolution, this command will run
Flyway then exit.
  -c, --config=<config>   Path to a configuration file, default: /root/.
                            kestra/config.yml)
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
      --internal-log      Change also log level for internal log, default:
                            false)
  -l, --log-level=<logLevel>
                          Change log level (values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
                            ERROR; default: INFO)
  -p, --plugins=<pluginsPath>
                          Path to plugins directory , default: ./plugins)
  -v, --verbose           Change log level. Multiple -v options increase the
                            verbosity.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
```
