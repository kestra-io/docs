Manage the environment your code is executed with Task Runners.

## Overview

Task Runners are extensible, pluggable systems capable of executing your tasks in arbitrary remote environments.

Each `taskRunner` is identified by its `type`. The [Process](../task-runners/04.types/01.process-task-runner.md) and [Docker](../task-runners/04.types/02.docker-task-runner.md) task runners are fully open-source and located within the [Kestra repository](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra). By default, Kestra runs all script tasks using the Docker task runner.

Here's an example of the Docker Task Runner configured to use the `centos` container image:

```yaml
id: docker_task_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    containerImage: centos
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"

```

You can learn more in the [Docker Task Runner documentation](../task-runners/04.types/02.docker-task-runner.md).

Here's an example of the Process Task Runner:

```yaml
id: process_task_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

You can learn more in the [Process Task Runner documentation](../task-runners/04.types/01.process-task-runner.md).
