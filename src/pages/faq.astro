                <p>
                    Kestra is an open-source orchestrator designed to bring
                    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices to all workflows
                    — from those orchestrating mission-critical operations,
                    business processes, and data pipelines to simple
                    Zapier-style automation. Built with an API-first philosophy,
                    Kestra enables users to define and manage data pipelines
                    through a simple YAML configuration file. This approach
                    frees you from being tied to a specific client
                    implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and easier
                    integration with various tools and services.

                <p>
                    A declarative orchestrator is a system that allows you to
                    define and manage complex workflows using a high-level,
                    descriptive language. Instead of specifying the exact steps
                    and sequences to achieve a specific outcome, a declarative
                    orchestrator lets you define the desired end state and the
                    system figures out how to reach it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kestra is a declarative orchestrator designed for managing
                    all kinds of workflows. It uses YAML (Yet Another Markup
                    Language) to define workflows in a human-readable and
                    structured format. Kestra workflows consist of tasks and
                    triggers that represent various data processing operations,
                    connected by data dependencies and control flow structures.

                client:visible
            >
                <p>
                    By using a declarative approach, Kestra simplifies the
                    development, maintenance, and scalability of workflows. It
                    allows you to focus on the high-level goals and objectives
                    of your data workflows, while Kestra takes care of executing
                    the tasks and handling errors, retries, and parallelism.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some key benefits of using Kestra as a declarative
                    orchestrator include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Improved readability and maintainability: Declarative
                        workflows are easier to understand and modify, making it
                        simpler for teams to collaborate and maintain their data
                        pipelines over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enhanced flexibility: Declarative orchestration enables
                        easy modification and extension of workflows as
                        requirements change, without the need for extensive
                        refactoring.

                <p>
                    Kestra flows are primarily defined in YAML, which provides a
                    simple and human-readable syntax for describing your data
                    workflows. In addition to YAML, you can also use various
                    scripting languages within your tasks, such as Python, R,
                    Node.js, Julia, Ruby, Shell, or PowerShell, to perform
                    custom operations and data transformations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Kestra supports Docker, which enables you to
                    execute tasks using any language, expanding the range of
                    possibilities for your workflows. This flexibility allows
                    you to leverage the power of different programming languages
                    within your Kestra flows to suit your specific requirements.

                    YAML's simplicity and readability make it easy to understand
                    and maintain your data workflows. Kestra provides extensive
                    support for various YAML features, such as variables, loops,
                    and conditions, allowing you to create complex workflows
                    without the need for a separate programming language. If you
                    require more advanced functionality, you can always use
                    scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, or Bash within
                    your tasks to extend your flows' capabilities.
