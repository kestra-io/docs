const GENERAL_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is Kestra?",
        answer: "Kestra is an open-source orchestrator designed to bring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices to all workflows — from those orchestrating mission-critical operations, business processes, and data pipelines to simple Zapier-style automation. Built with an API-first philosophy, Kestra enables users to define and manage data pipelines through a simple YAML configuration file. This approach frees you from being tied to a specific client implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and easier integration with various tools and services."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a declarative orchestrator?",
        answer: "<p>A declarative orchestrator is a system that allows you to define and manage complex workflows using a high-level, descriptive language. Instead of specifying the exact steps and sequences to achieve a specific outcome, a declarative orchestrator lets you define the desired end state and the system figures out how to reach it.</p><p>Kestra is a declarative orchestrator designed for managing all kinds of workflows. It uses YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to define workflows in a human-readable and structured format. Kestra workflows consist of tasks and triggers that represent various data processing operations, connected by data dependencies and control flow structures.</p>"
    },
    {
        question: "What are the advantages of a declarative orchestrator?",
        answer: "<p>By using a declarative approach, Kestra simplifies the development, maintenance, and scalability of workflows. It allows you to focus on the high-level goals and objectives of your data workflows, while Kestra takes care of executing the tasks and handling errors, retries, and parallelism.</p><p>Some key benefits of using Kestra as a declarative orchestrator include:</p><ol><li>Improved readability and maintainability: Declarative workflows are easier to understand and modify, making it simpler for teams to collaborate and maintain their data pipelines over time.</li><li>Enhanced flexibility: Declarative orchestration enables easy modification and extension of workflows as requirements change, without the need for extensive refactoring.</li></ol>"
    },
    {
        question: "Who can benefit from using Kestra?",
