                <h3>Deep Dive into YAML's Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Structures:</strong> YAML supports various data structures, such as mappings, sequences, and scalars, allowing for the flexible representation of complex data workflows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Comments:</strong> Inline comments in YAML files facilitate better communication and documentation within data teams, ensuring clarity and understanding of workflow logic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Custom Tags and Types:</strong> YAML allows for the definition of custom tags and types, enabling the creation of domain-specific languages and abstractions tailored to your data orchestration needs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Empower Your Team with Declarative Orchestration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accelerate Time to Value:</strong> Declarative orchestration modernized the creation and maintenance of data pipelines, enabling data teams to deliver results faster and more efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Increase Agility:</strong> By using a declarative approach, data teams can quickly adapt to changing business requirements without the need to overhaul complex procedural code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduce Error Rates:</strong> Declarative workflows help minimize errors by allowing data teams to focus on defining the desired outcome, while Kestra's orchestrator takes care of the execution.
