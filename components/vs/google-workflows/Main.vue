                <h2>The Differences Between Kestra and Google Workflows</h2>
                <p>Kestra is an open-source orchestration platform that enables automation across cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments. With an everything-as-code approach, YAML-based workflow definitions, and an extensible plugin ecosystem, it provides flexibility for both technical and non-technical users.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows is a cloud-based orchestration service designed for sequencing Google Cloud services. It lacks enterprise-grade orchestration features, has no built-in UI for workflow design, and is limited in multi-cloud or hybrid environments.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Installation and Setup</h3>
                <p>Kestra supports Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, allowing deployment across cloud providers and on-premises. Google Workflows is fully managed by Google Cloud with no on-prem installation option.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Workflow Definition</h3>
                <p>Kestra workflows are defined in YAML with inline scripting support (Python, JavaScript, SQL, Bash). It includes a no-code editor for visual design and a plugin ecosystem for extended functionality.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows also uses YAML or JSON but lacks a UI-based designer and a plugin system. Custom logic must be implemented through REST calls.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Scalability and Performance</h3>
                <p>Kestra dynamically scales across distributed environments, supporting both event-driven and scheduled workflows.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows scales within GCP but faces complexity when integrating external services.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Integration Capabilities</h3>
                <p>Kestra offers extensive integrations via plugins, supporting AWS, GCP, Azure, BigQuery, Snowflake, Kafka, and more.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows integrates deeply with Google services but lacks native support for third-party tools, requiring custom REST calls.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Monitoring and Observability</h3>
                <p>Kestra provides built-in monitoring, real-time execution tracking, and logging.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows relies on Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring, requiring multiple services for tracking execution.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Open-Source vs. Proprietary</h3>
                <p>Kestra is fully open-source with an active community and enterprise add-ons. It avoids vendor lock-in and supports deep customization.</p>
                <p>Google Workflows is a proprietary GCP service, locking organizations into its infrastructure and billing model.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>UI & Workflow Management:</strong> Kestra has a no-code UI; Google Workflows requires manual YAML/JSON definitions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Kestra supports plugins; Google Workflows requires custom development for external integrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Cloud Support:</strong> Kestra runs anywhere; Google Workflows is tied to GCP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debugging & Monitoring:</strong> Kestra has built-in tracking; Google Workflows relies on Cloud Logging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triggering & Dependencies:</strong> Kestra natively supports triggers and dependencies; Google Workflows requires external solutions.</li>
