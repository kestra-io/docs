description: |
  This flow will never launch the `skipped` task because that task is disabled.
  Also note how the log level of each task is different. This is useful to limit which logs should be stored in the database (repository).

tasks:
  - id: first
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: first {{task.id}}
    logLevel: TRACE

  - id: skipped
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    disabled: true
    format: second {{task.type}}
    logLevel: WARN

  - id: last
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: the name of the flow is {{flow.id}}
    logLevel: ERROR
