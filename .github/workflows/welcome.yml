            ### Hey @{fc-author} :wave: 

            Thanks for raising your first pull request - we really appreciate it! :heart:

            Make sure you've checked our [contribution guide](https://kestra.io/docs/contribute-to-kestra/contributing), and don't forget to give us a star! :star:

            If you're looking for more issues to contribute to, we'd suggest checking our [curated list of good first issues](https://go.kestra.io/contributing) to see if there's something you find interesting and feel comfortable tackling independently. You can further filter the list by labels to narrow down the results (we recommend `area/backend`, `area/frontend`, or `area/plugin`, depending on your preferences).
