# Templates

Templates are lists of tasks that can be shared between flows. You can define a template and call it from other flows, allowing them to share a list of tasks and keep these tasks updated without changing your flow.

All tasks in a template will be executed sequentially; you can provide the same tasks that are found in a *standard* flow, including an *errors* branch.

Templates can have arguments passed via the `args` property.

<div style="text-align: right">
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Template">Template Task documentation</a>
</div>

## Example

Below is a flow sample that will include a template:
```yaml
id: with-template
namespace: io.kestra.tests

inputs:
  - name: store
    type: STRING
    required: true

tasks:
  - id: template
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Template
    namespace: io.kestra.tests
    templateId: template
    args:
      renamedStore: "{{ inputs.store }}
```

If the template is defined like this:

```yaml
id: template
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: 1-return
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "{{ parent.outputs.args.renamedStore }}"
```

It will produce a flow similar to this one:

```yaml
id: with-template
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: template
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Sequential
    tasks:
      - id: 1-return
        type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
        format: "{{ inputs.store }}"
```

All the tasks within the template will be *copied* at runtime.

:::warning
From the template, you can access all the variables defined on the context executions. However, this is highly discouraged. The best will be to use the `args` property to rename variables from the global context to the template local one.
