# Flow
> The Flow is the base of your workload, it defines all the tasks you want to perform and the order in which they will be run.

## Flow sample

The flow model is a YAML document describing how Kestra will schedule and compute your workload.

Here is a full sample flow demonstrating the flow definition.
The following code is a sample that uses tasks available in Kestra for testing purposes.

## Flow Properties

```yaml
id: samples
namespace: io.kestra.tests
revision: 8

description: "Some flow **documentation** in *Markdown*"

labels:
  env: prd
  country: FR

inputs:
  - name: my-value
    type: STRING
    required: false
    defaults: "default value"
    description: This is a not required my-value

variables:
  first: "1"
  second: "{{vars.first}} > 2"

tasks:
  - id: date
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    description: "Some tasks **documentation** in *Markdown*"
    disabled: false
    format: "A log line content with a contextual date variable {{taskrun.startDate}}"

errors:
  - id: failed-echo
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Echo
    format: I'm failing {{task.id}}

| Field | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
|`id`|Flow identifier, must be unique across namespaces.|
|`namespace`|Each task lives in one arbitrary namespace, this is useful for task organization. A Namespace is required.|
|`revision`|A Flow version, handled internally by kestra, and is incremented for each modification save, not a required field since it is autogenerated.|
|`description`|Description for documentation, more details [here](../documentation/).|
|`labels`|List of labels (key & value as string) for this flow.|
|`inputs`|List of inputs for the current flow, more details [here](../inputs/).|
|`inputs.[].name`|The name for this input, allowing it to be used as variables(vars) on the current flow.|
|`inputs.[].type`|The type for this input, for example (STRING, FILE, etc...)|
|`inputs.[].required`|Determines if the input is required (and prevents the flow from executing without this input).|
|`inputs.[].defaults`|The default value of the input if no value is provided.|
|`inputs.[].description`|Description for documentation, more details [here](../documentation/).|
|`variables`|A list of variables (such as key, value, etc) for the current flow that can be reached with <code v-pre>{{ vars.name }}</code>.|
|`tasks`|A list of related tasks for the current flow, all tasks will be run sequentially.|
|`tasks.[].id`|The **unique** task id for the current flow.|
|`tasks.[].type`|The task type is a fully qualified Java class name.|
|`tasks.[].description`|Description for documentation, more details [here](../documentation/).|
|`tasks.[].disabled`|Whether the task is disabled, and will be kept on the flow source, but never executed.|
|`tasks.[].timeout`|This is the max duration of the current task, in a Duration format like `PT15M`.|
|`tasks.[].xxx`|Each task type comes with specific fields that are documented on the [plugins page](../../../plugins/).|
|`errors`|A list of error tasks for the current flow, all listed tasks will be run sequentially only if there is an error on the current execution.|
|`errors.[].xxx`|The same properties as `tasks`, error can be any normal tasks, more details [here](../errors-handling/).|
|`listeners`|List of listeners for the current flow, more details [here](../listeners/).|
|`listeners.[].description`|Description for documentation, more details [here](../documentation/).|
|`listeners.[].condition`|The condition that will be validated in order to launch or skip this listener.|
|`listeners.[].tasks.[].xxx`|The same properties as `tasks`, the task to run for this listener.|
|`triggers`|Triggers are external events (such as date and/or time, for example) to launch this job, more details [here](../triggers/).|
|`triggers.[].id`|A **unique** trigger id which can't be updated.|
|`triggers.[].type`|The trigger type is a full qualified Java class name.|
|`triggers.[].description`|Description for documentation, more details [here](../documentation/).|
|`triggers.[].disabled`| Whether the trigger is disabled.|
|`triggers.[].xxx`|Like tasks, each trigger has its own properties.|
|`taskDefaults`|Default values for current tasks, in order to avoid repeating the same properties on each tasks.|
|`taskDefaults.[].type`|The task type is a full qualified Java class name.|
|`taskDefaults.[].forced`|If the default value is set to Forced, the taskDefault will always overwrite the user properties for the task (default `false`).|
|`taskDefaults.[].values.xxx`|The properties (just like Tasks) that you want to be set as default.|
|`disabled`|The flow can be disabled to prevent any executions.|
