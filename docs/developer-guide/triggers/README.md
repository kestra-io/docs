# Triggers & schedule

Triggers are a way to start a flow with external events. For example, a trigger can be set for a scheduled date or waiting for an external event (such as file creation or another flows end).

Here are the currently available triggers:

* [Flow trigger](./flow.md)
* [Schedule](./schedule.md)
* [Webhook](./webhook.md)
