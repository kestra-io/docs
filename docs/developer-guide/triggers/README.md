# Triggers & schedule

Triggers are a way to start a flow from an external event. For example, a trigger can be set for a scheduled date or waiting for an external event (such as file creation or another flow's end).

Here are the triggers available on Kestra core, a lot of plugins provide additional triggers:

* [Schedule](./schedule.md)
* [Webhook](./webhook.md)
* [Flow trigger](./flow.md)
