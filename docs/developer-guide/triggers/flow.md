# Flow trigger


```yaml
type: "org.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow"
```

> Kestra is able to trigger flow after another one. This allows chaining flow without need to update the base flows. 
  With that, you can break responsibility between different flow to different teams.

## Example
> This flow will be triggered after each successfully execution of flow `org.kestra.tests.trigger-flow` and forward the `uri` of `my-task` taskId outputs.
```yaml
id: trigger-flow-listener
namespace: org.kestra.tests
revision: 1

inputs:
  - name: from-parent
    type: STRING

tasks:
  - id: only-no-input
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "v1: {{trigger.executionId}}"

triggers:
  - id: listen-flow
    type: org.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    inputs:
      from-parent: '{{ outputs.my-task.uri }}'
    conditions:
      - type: org.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
        namespace: org.kestra.tests
        flowId: trigger-flow
      - type: org.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionStatusCondition
        in:
          - SUCCESS
```

> This flow will be triggered after the successful execution of both flows `flow-a` & `flow-b` during the current day. When the conditions are met, the counter is reset and can be re-triggered during the same day. See [MultipleCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/org.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.MultipleCondition.html) for more details
```yaml
id: trigger-multiplecondition-listener
namespace: org.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: only-listener
    type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "let's go "

            type: org.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition

## Inputs

### `id`
* **Type:** <Badge vertical="middle" text="String" />
* **Required:** ✔

> unique for a flow 


### `inputs`
* **Type:** <Badge vertical="middle" text="Map<String, Object>" />
* **Required:** ❌
* **Dynamic:** ✔

> fill input of this flow based on output of current flow, allowing to pass data or file on the triggered flow


::: warning
If you provide invalid input, the flow will be created and already state as FAILED! Since there is no task started, you can't log any reason visible on the ui.
So you will need to go to server log to understand the error
:::

### `conditions`
* **Type:** <Badge vertical="middle" text="List<Condition>" />
* **Required:** ❌

> List of  [Conditions](../conditions) in order to limit the flow trigger. 

::: warning
If you don't provide any conditions, the flow will be triggered for **EVERY execution** of **EVERY flow** on your instance.
