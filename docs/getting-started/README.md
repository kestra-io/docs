# Install and configure Kestra for flow developments
<!-- ------------------------ -->


## Presentation

In this tutorial we'll be interested in how to setup a working Kestra environement for flow developments By following this tutorial, you will be able to finally describe and execute a sample flow.

In a next tutorial, we'll see what tools and concepts are available in Kestra and how to efficiently use them.

### Goals

* Install **java JRE 11** is a requirement to let kestra run properly
* Download and run **Kestra executable** to run our first flow command

::: tip
This is windows based tutorial. The same tutorial will work on linux systems but some setup steps will be different. The following should also work on macos.

## Install java JRE 11

### On windows

You may have an existing java installation on your computer. You can check this install by opening a window command line and typing `java    *-version`.
If you have either a response from the terminal like *java: command not found* or *java version 8*, then you have to install the following java 11 version.

* Download and install Java JRE 11 [from here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.6%2B10/OpenJDK11U-jre_x86-32_windows_hotspot_11.0.6_10.msi) will let your computer be able to run Kestra executable (this is a 32bit version for windows 7. Choose another version here if you need something else.)
* Run the installer and add **set JAVA_HOME variable** to the install like the picture below

* Check the install by opening a window command line and do the following command `java --version`. Ensure you have the version 11 at least.

### On Linux

for debian / ubuntu based distros, you can run the following command to install JAVA :

`sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre`

You are now ready to run Kestra.

## Setup Kestra

Kestra is a java application. You will have to download a built version and then run commands in the terminal to test it works as expected.

* Download Kestra [lastest version here](https://download.kestra.io)
* Move the downloaded file in some cool place like `c:\kestra\kestra-xxx.jar` (on linux `/home/<username>/kestra` will be ok)
* Add the following flow sample file to the following location *c:\kestra\sample.yaml* with the following content :

::: warning
Beware the flow file **MUST** be a **.yaml** extension (.yml will not work)
:::

```yaml
id: sample
namespace: org.kestra.tests

tasks:
- id: date
  type: org.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
  format: "{{taskrun.startDate}}"
```

* Check your setup is ready to go by issuing the follwing command in the terminal `cd c:\kestra` then `java -jar kestra-xxx.jar test sample.yaml`

(Right click on the image, then display image to see the entire output)

On the command output above, you can see the flow has been processed properly in a while.

::: tip
The output will render better on windows soon. for now log color output does not render. On unix terminals, output renders will colors.

If all of this work, you are ready to go further with kestra. You now may have a look at Kestra concepts and flow definition tutorial to start developping flows for kestra.
