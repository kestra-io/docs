# Databases configuration

First, you need to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql
```

## Minimal examples
The most important thing is to configure the way Kestra connect to a database. For now, Kestra support PostgreSQL and MySQL.


Here is a minimal MySQL configuration example :
```yaml
datasources:
  mysql:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kestra
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: MYSQL
```


Here is minimal PostgreSQL configuration:
```yaml
datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
```


## `datasources.*` properties
Since Kestra is built upon [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP), many configurations are available in order to configure the database pool:

## Queues configuration

### `kestra.jdbc.queues`

Kestra queues based on database simulate queues doing long polling. It queries a `queues` table to detect new messages. Change these parameters to reduce the latency (but increase load on the database).

- `kestra.jdbc.queues.min-poll-interval`: is the minimum duration between 2 polls
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.max-poll-interval`: is the maximum duration between 2 polls
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-switch-interval`: is the duration when no message are received switching from min polling to max polling (ex: one message received, the `min-poll-interval` is used, if no new message arrived with `poll-switch-interval`, we switch to `max-poll-interval`).

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      min-poll-interval: 100ms
      max-poll-interval: 1000ms
      poll-switch-interval: 5s

```

### `kestra.jdbc.cleaner`

Kestra cleans the `queues` table to avoid infinite grow of this table. You can control how often you want this cleaning to happen, and how long we will keep messages in the queue with `retention`.

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    cleaner:
      initial-delay: 1h
      fixed-delay: 1h
      retention: 7d
```
