# Manual deployment

If you want to deploy Kestra for your self (within your own environment) , we provide a Standalone jar that allows deployment on any environment you want.

The latest jar can be downloaded [here](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable jar:
- For Linux & MacOs, we run it `./kestra-VERSION`
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat` and call it from `CMD`.
