                                        <strong>Why did we create a data orchestration platform?</strong><br />
                                        For many years in the automation and workflow planning landscape, we were frustrated that we <strong>did not see a working, professional open-source solution</strong> that was suitable for either simple or complex projects.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        During our consulting missions, our tireless research for reliable, professional, and testable orchestrators ended <strong>in failure</strong> â€” none were scalable, they were too complex to use, not production ready, and had poor user interface.
                                    </p>

                                            A challenge presented itself to us: <strong>Develop your own tool! One Platform to rule them all ^^</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Above all, we are seeking to challenge the ecosystem
                                            to give you a tool to allows to <router-link to="/features/features">orchestrate and automate your data</router-link>, workflows, and batches all with simplicity, autonomy, and high performance.
                                            This has been our ambition since day one and will continue to challenge us after the <router-link to="/blogs/2022-02-01-kestra-opensource">public launch of the Kestra project.</router-link>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We developed our open source platform with careful precision and dedication as part of a mission for one of the Europe's leading retailers, <router-link to="/blogs/2022-02-22-leroy-merlin-usage-kestra">Leroy Merlin, who were in need of high-capacity data management.</router-link>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The platform is <strong>operational, in production, and performing</strong> to the satisfaction of several hundred internal users who have seen their productivity gain skyrocket since using Kestra. What a reward it is for us to build something new that brings <strong>complete satisfaction</strong> to its users.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Now we are at the <router-link to="/blogs/2022-02-01-kestra-opensource">stage of our public launch</router-link> with the aim of bringing Kestra to everyone who needs it. We have structured a company and our team is <strong>ready to help</strong> you with your future tests and integrations.
