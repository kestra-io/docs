# Technical Customer Success Manager

## ❣️ Who are we?

At Kestra Technologies, we take immense pride in being a community-driven company, embraced by a team of outstanding individuals. With over 3.000 organizations orchestrating their workflows with Kestra, we embody a collective presence that sets us apart.

Kestra is The Open-Source Declarative Orchestration Platform made for mission-critical applications, data pipelines, infrastructure operations, and business workflows for organizations of all sizes. By enabling Everything-as-Code and Everything from the UI, we unify engineering teams seeking simple and versatile orchestration solutions running Everywhere All At Once.

## 🙏🏾 Why your role is important at Kestra?

The Kestra Go-To-Market (GTM) Team unifies various customer-facing positions, including Sales, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, and Alliances. After a successful fundraising in September 2023, our customer base has significantly grown and we need to move our Customer Success operations to the next level.

While the Customer Success Framework is currently being revamped, the Technical Customer Success Manager is expected to reduce the Engineering Team overhead by handling the support requests & troubleshooting, improve the Customer Health Index by delivering more value to the customer through a large set of methods & rituals and maximize the total value of the customer to Kestra.

In the GTM Team, we thrive through the following values, and being eager to embody them is deeply required to enjoy this role.

-   We champion Sales as Trusted Advisors over shady sales-y talk.
-   We're tech-savvy and product hands-on to deliver positive business outcomes.
-   We practice active care and look forward to building customer empathy.
-   We share actionable feedback and positive vibes with the Team.

## 📋 What will my job look like daily?

As a Technical Customer Success Manager, your daily will always be a mix of diverse responsibilities, such as managing direct support requests coming from multiple channels, proactively helping our customers in Kestra's installation, engaging with customers for routine health checks, driving complete onboarding & product adoption motions, monitoring customer progress regularly, collecting feedback to measure the NPS, consistently improving the self-serve Customer Portal....

You'll be leading the Customer Success Framework & Operations, which means...

-   You'll be the owner of the customer lifecycle, from Onboarding & Adoption to Expansion & Advocacy.
-   You'll be in charge of producing standard & regular reporting on the CS Metrics (CSAT, Churn Rate...)
-   Your routine should match the rhythm of the different "Customer Milestones", from Day 1 Toast to Bi-Annual Executive Business Reviews
-   You'll have the self-serve Customer Portal under your responsibility.

We envision this role as an all-encompassing 360° position that blends the responsibilities of a customer success manager, a technical account manager and a solution architect.

> Note: this role is a "hands-on" position. As a matter of example, we expect the candidate to have enough technical knowledge to install Kestra via Docker on an EC2 (or managed K8S) instance, configure a simple PostgreSQL database, and provision the resources via Terraform.

## 📍 Where is the job located?

This role is fully remote, +/- 2h from the Paris Time zone.
