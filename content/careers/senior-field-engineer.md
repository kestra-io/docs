## üôèüèæ Why your role is important at Kestra?

The Kestra Go-To-Market (GTM) Team unifies various customer-facing positions, including Sales, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, and Alliances. After [a successful fundraising in September 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/kestra-is-an-open-source-data-orchestration-platform-for-complex-workflows/?guccounter=1), our customer base has significantly grown and we need to move our Customer Success operations to the next level. 

While the Customer Success Framework is currently being revamped, the Senior Field Software Engineer is expected to reduce the Engineering Team overhead by delivering architecture design recommendations on a wide array of technologies, providing hands-on assistance, and handling the L3 support requests & troubleshooting.
