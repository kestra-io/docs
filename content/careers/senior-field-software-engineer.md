## ❣️ Who are we?

At [Kestra Technologies](https://kestra.io/), we are a community-driven company supported by a passionate community. With over 3,000 organizations orchestrating their workflows with Kestra, together, we form a powerful collective that transforms the orchestration landscape.

[Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra.io) is The Open-Source Declarative Orchestration Platform made for mission-critical applications, data pipelines, infrastructure operations, and business workflows for organizations of all sizes. By enabling Everything-as-Code and Everything from the UI, we unify engineering teams seeking simple and versatile orchestration solutions running Everywhere All At Once.

## 🙏🏾 Why your role is important at Kestra?

The Kestra Go-To-Market (GTM) Team unifies various customer-facing positions, including Sales, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, and Alliances. After [a successful fundraising in September 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/04/kestra-is-an-open-source-data-orchestration-platform-for-complex-workflows/?guccounter=1), our customer base has significantly grown and we need to move our Customer Success operations to the next level. 

While the Customer Success Framework is currently being revamped, the Senior Field Software Engineer is expected to reduce the Engineering Team overhead by delivering architecture design recommendations on a wide array of technologies, providing hands-on assistance, and handling the L3 support requests & troubleshooting.

In the GTM Team, we thrive through the following values, and being eager to embody them is deeply required to enjoy this role.

- We champion Sales as Trusted Advisors over shady sales-y talk.
