**Training**

The Training Service is a unique training session that aims to introduce the Client to main concepts to guarantee the services quality. It should be delivered to a reasonable number of users determined by Kestra. It does not include any of the responsibilities detailed in the excluded matter on this Appendix.

**Professional Services**

Response time: 1 business day.

-   Severity 2 (High): A running instance reports degraded performances/limited functions and/or a workaround is available.It affects partially the company's ability to perform its business.

Response time: 2 business days.

-   Severity 3 (Medium): A running instance reports minor errors. A workaround is available. It affects a small number of users but not the company's business.

Response time: 3 business days.

-   Severity 4 (Low): A running instance doesn't report any error. It affects users having questions around the product.

Response time: 5 business days.

Business day coverage is from Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm CET time zone (UTC+1) on non-French holidays.
