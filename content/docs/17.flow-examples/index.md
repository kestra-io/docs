title: Flow examples
---

The example from Kestra's guided tour is a good starting point; it is available when running Kestra for the first time and can see here: [Example guided tour](./example-guided-tour.md).

Following is a list of other examples that can be downloaded:
- [Each nested](./each-nested.md): Example of an each expression to iterate over a list of values.
- [Subflow](./subflow.md): This flow will launch a subflow passing parameters, waiting until the end of the flow and gathering the output of a task.
- [Switch](./switch.md): Depending on the value passed as the input, the will flow branch to different tasks. If there is no matching value, the `defaults` task is used.
