On the Namespace page, you can configure secrets, task defaults and variables that can be used within any flow defined in that namespace. We will see in detail about defining each of these configurations at the namespace level, and using them in the flows.

## Secrets

On the Namespaces page, select the namespace where you want to define the secrets. Go to the `Secrets` tab. You can see all the secrets associated with this namespace on this `Secrets` tab's page. Click on "Add a secret" button on the top right of the page.

You can now define the secret by providing the Key and the Secret value. Save the secret by clicking on the "Save" button at the bottom.

The secret key should now start appearing on the `Secrets` tab's page. You can edit the secret's value or delete the secret by click on the appropriate button towards the right of the secret row. You can refer the secret in the flow by using the Key. Here is an example flow:

```yaml
id: query-mysql
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  id: query
  type: "io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.mysql.Query"
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
  username: root
  password: "{{ secret('MYSQL_PASSWORD') }}"
  sql: select * from employees
  fetchOne: true
```

Note that you could refer this secret only in the flows defined within the same namespace under which the secret has been defined.

## Task Defaults

Task Defaults can also be defined at the namespace level. These task defaults are then applied for all the tasks of the corresponding type defined in the flows under the same namespace.

On the Namespaces page, select the namespace where you want to define the task defaults. Go to the `Task defaults` tab. You can now start writing the task defaults here, or add to the existing task defaults. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

You can also refer the secrets defined with the same namespace in the task defaults.

Now, for the given example of task defaults, while defining the flow within the same namespace, you need not specifically mention the password for the MySQL query task as shown in the following flow:

```yaml
id: query-mysql
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  id: query
  type: "io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.mysql.Query"
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
  username: root
  sql: select * from employees
  fetchOne: true
```

The password would be applied from the task defaults defined at the namespace level.

## Variables

Variables defined at the namespace level can be referred by any flow defined under the same namespace.

On the Namespaces page, select the namespace where you want to define the variables. Go to the `Variables` tab. You can now define the variables on this page. Save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page.

![define_variables.png](/docs/enterprise/define_variables.png)

Here is an example flow where the namespace variable is being used:

```yaml
id: query-mysql
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  id: query
  type: "io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.mysql.Query"
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
  username: "{{ namespace.mysql_user }}"
  sql: select * from employees
  fetchOne: true
```
