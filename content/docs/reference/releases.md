Track Kestra’s long‑term support (LTS) releases alongside the fast cadence of innovation releases.

## Release model

Kestra maintains two tracks:

- **LTS (Long Term Support)** releases receive critical fixes for a defined window so production environments can upgrade on a predictable cadence.
- **Innovation** releases deliver new functionality more frequently; they become candidates for the next LTS once they stabilize.

## Current LTS versions

| LTS Version | Release Date | Supported Until | Release Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 2025‑09‑09 | 2026‑09‑09 (planned) | [GitHub Release](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases/tag/v1.0.0) |

## Upcoming milestones

| Track | Planned Release | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 1.x LTS | 2026 (TBD) | Final support window and release notes will be announced as the innovation branch stabilizes. |
| Innovation | Rolling | See the [GitHub releases feed](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/releases) for the latest features. |
