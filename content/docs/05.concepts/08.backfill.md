Backfills are replays of missed schedule intervals between a defined start and end date.

## Overview

Let's take the following flow as an example:

```yaml
id: scheduled_flow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: label
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Labels
    labels: # label to track scheduled date
      scheduledDate: "{{trigger.date ?? execution.startDate}}"
  - id: external_system_export
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "processing data for {{trigger.date ?? execution.startDate}}"
      - sleep $((RANDOM % 5 + 1))

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/30 * * * *"
```

This flow run every 30 minutes. However, imagine that your source system had an outage for 5 hours. The flow will miss 10 executions. To replay these missed executions, you can use the backfill feature.

::alert{type="info"}
**All missed schedules are automatically recovered by default.**

You can use Backfill if it's configured differently, e.g., to not recover missed schedules or only the most recent. Read more in the [dedicated documentation](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/01.schedule-trigger.md#recover-missed-schedules).

To backfill the missed executions, go to the **Triggers** tab on the Flow's detail page and click on the **Backfill executions** button.

You can then select the start and end date for the backfill. Additionally, you can set custom labels for the backfill executions to help you identify them in the future.

You can pause and resume the backfill process at any time, and by clicking on the **Details** button, you can see more details about that backfill process:

## Trigger Backfill via an API call

### Using cURL

You can invoke the backfill executions using the `cURL` call as follows:

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/release/triggers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KESTRA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "namespace": "dev",
    "flowId":    "scheduled_flow",
    "triggerId": "schedule",
    "backfill":  {
      "start": "2025-04-29T11:30:00Z",
      "end":   null,
      "labels": [
        {
          "key": "reason",
          "value": "outage"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

In the `backfill` attribute, you need to provide the start time for the backfill; the end time can be optionally provided. You can provide inputs to the flow with `inputs`, as well as assign labels to the backfill executions by providing key-value pairs in the `labels` section. In the example `reason:outage` is labelled to make it clear what caused the need to backfill.

Other attributes to this PUT call are `flowId`, `namespace`, and `triggerId` corresponding to the flow that is to backfilled.

### Using a Service Account

For Enterprise and Cloud users, the same process as above can be done with [Service Accounts](../06.enterprise/03.auth/service-accounts.md), so no human user needed to be involved. In this case, you must specify the Tenant to use in the request header and definition: `X-KESTRA-TENANT` and `tenantId`. In the example we use a Tenant named `production`. 

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/release/triggers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KESTRA_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Kestra-Tenant: production" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "namespace": "dev",
    "flowId":    "scheduled_flow",
    "triggerId": "schedule",
    "tenantId": "production",
    "backfill":  {
      "start": "2025-04-29T11:30:00Z",
      "end":   null,
      "labels": [
        {
          "key": "reason",
          "value": "outage"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

To use a Service Account, go to **Administration -> IAM -> Service Accounts**. From the Service Accounts tab, create a Service Account, generate an API Token, copy the token, and give the Service Account the appropriate access to backfill a flow. Use this API token in your `cURL` instead of a user's token.

The interactive demo below walks through the steps one-by-one.

### Using Python requests

You can invoke the backfill exections using the Python requests as follows:

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/triggers'

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

data = {
  "backfill": {
    "start": "2025-06-03T06:30:00.000Z",
    "end": None,
    "inputs": None,
    "labels": [
      {
        "key": "reason",
        "value": "outage"
      }
    ]
  },
  "flowId": "scheduled_flow",
  "namespace": "company.team",
  "triggerId": "schedule"
}

response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)
```

With this code, you will be invoking the backfill for `scheduled_flow` flow under `company.team` namespace based on `schedule` trigger ID within the flow. The number of backfills that will be executed will depend on the schedule present in the `schedule` trigger and the `start` and `end` times mentioned in the backfill. When the `end` time is null, as in this case, the `end` time would be considered as the present time.
