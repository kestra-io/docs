Manage data processed by tasks.

Kestra's primary purpose is to orchestrate data processing via tasks, so data is central to each flow's execution.

Depending on the task, data can be stored inside the execution context or inside Kestra's internal storage. You can also manually store data inside Kestra's KV store by using [dedicated tasks](/plugins/core/tasks/kv/io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set).

Some tasks give you the choice of where you want to store the data, usually using a `fetchType` property or the three `fetch`/`fetchOne`/`store` properties.

For example, using the DynamoDB Query task:

```yaml
id: query
type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.dynamodb.Query
tableName: persons
keyConditionExpression: id = :id
expressionAttributeValues:
  :id: "1"
fetchType: FETCH
```

The `fetchType` property can have four values:
- `FETCH_ONE`: fetches the first row and set it in a task output attribute (the `row` attribute for DynamoDB); the data is stored inside the execution context.
- `FETCH`: fetches all rows and set them in a task output attribute (the `rows` attribute for DynamoDB); the data is stored inside the execution context.
- `STORE`: stores all rows inside Kestra's internal storage. The internal storage returns a URI usually set in the task output attribute `uri` and that can be used to retrieve the file from the internal storage.
- `NONE`: does nothing.

The three `fetch`/`fetchOne`/`store` properties do the same but using three different task properties instead of a single one.

## Storing data

### Storing data inside the flow execution context

Data can be stored as variables inside the flow execution context. This can be convenient for sharing data between tasks.

To do so, tasks store data as [output attributes](../04.workflow-components/06.outputs.md) that are then available inside the flow via Pebble expressions like `{{outputs.taskName.attributeName}}`.

Be careful, the size of the data is significant, this increases the size of the flow execution context, which can lead to slow execution and increase the size of the execution storage inside Kestra's repository.

::alert{type="warning"}
Depending on the Kestra internal queue and repository implementation, there can be a hard limit on the size of the flow execution context as it is stored as a single row/message. Usually, this limit is around 1MB, so this is important to avoid storing large amounts of data inside the flow execution context.
::

### Storing data inside the internal storage

Kestra has an internal storage that can store data of any size. By default, the internal storage uses the host filesystem, but plugins exist to use other implementations like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blobs storage. See [internal storage configuration](../configuration/index.md#internal-storage).

When using the internal storage, data is, by default, stored using [Amazon Ion](https://amazon-ion.github.io/ion-docs/) format.

Tasks that can store data inside the internal storage usually have an output attribute named `uri` that can be used to access this file in following tasks.

The following example uses the [DynamoDB Query](/plugins/plugin-aws/dynamodb/io.kestra.plugin.aws.dynamodb.query) task to query a table and the [FTP Upload](/plugins/plugin-fs/ftp/io.kestra.plugin.fs.ftp.upload) task to send the retrieved rows to an external FTP server.

```yaml
tasks:
- id: query
  type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.dynamodb.Query
  tableName: persons
  keyConditionExpression: id = :id
  expressionAttributeValues:
    :id: "1"
  fetchType: STORE

- id: upload
  type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.ftp.Upload
  host: localhost
  port: 80
  from: "{{ outputs.query.uri }}"
  to: "/upload/file.ion"
```

If you need to access data from the internal storage, you can use the `read()` function to read the file's content as a string.

Dedicated tasks allow managing the files stored inside the internal storage:
- [Concat](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Concat): concat multiple files.
- [Delete](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Delete): delete a file.
- [Size](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Size): get the size of a file.
- [Split](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Split): split a file into multiple files depending on the size of the file or the number of rows.

::alert{type="warning"}
This should be the main method for storing and carrying large data from task to task.
As an example, if you know that a [HTTP Request](/plugins/plugin-fs/http/io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request) returns a heavy payload, you should consider using [HTTP Download](/plugins/plugin-fs/http/io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download) along with a [Serdes](/plugins/plugin-serdes) instead of carrying raw data in [Flow Execution Context](#storing-data-inside-the-flow-execution-context)
::

### Storing data inside the KV store

Dedicated tasks can store data inside Kestra's KV store. The KV store transparently uses Kestra's internal storage as its backend store.

The KV store allows storing data that will be shared by all executions of the same namespace. You can think of it as a key/value store dedicated to a namespace.

The following tasks are available:
- [Set](/plugins/core/tasks/kv/io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set): set data in key/value pair.
- [Get](/plugins/core/tasks/kv/io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get): get data from key/value pair.
- [Delete](/plugins/core/tasks/kv/io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Delete): delete a key/value pair.

Example:

```yaml
tasks:
- id: set_data
  type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
  key: name
  value: John Doe

- id: get_data
  type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get
  key: name
```

In the next example, the flow uses `Set`, `Get` and `Delete` on the data:

::collapse{title="Example Flow"}

```yaml
id: kv_store_example
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: set_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: user_name
    value: John Doe

  - id: get_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get
    key: user_name

  - id: log_state
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ kv('user_name') }}"

  - id: set_new_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: user_name
    value: Bob Smith

  - id: get_new_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get
    key: user_name

  - id: log_new_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ kv('user_name') }}"

  - id: delete_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Delete
    key: user_name

  - id: get_deleted_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Get
    description: You will not get any data as the corresponding key is deleted in the earlier task.
    key: user_name
```

When we `Set` a new value for `user_name`, we have to use another `Get` task to get the most up to date value, and then reference the `Get` task `id` in our log underneath to get the latest value. The same applies to the `Delete` task. In order to show that it has been deleted, we try to get the data from the key deleetd in the `delete_data` task to show that.

## Processing data

For basic data processing, you can leverage Kestra's [Pebble templating engine](../expressions/index.md).

For more complex data transformations, Kestra offers various data processing plugins including transform tasks or custom scripts.

### Converting files

Files from the internal storage can be converted from/to the Ion format to/from another format using the [Serdes](/plugins/plugin-serdes) plugin.

The following formats are currently available: Avro, JSON, XML, and Parquet.

Each format offers a **reader** to read an Ion serialized data file and write it in the target format and a **writer** to read a file in a specific format and write it as an Ion serialized data file.

For example, to convert an Ion file to CSV, then back to Ion:

```yaml
tasks:
- id: query
  type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.dynamodb.Query
  tableName: persons
  keyConditionExpression: id = :id
  expressionAttributeValues:
    :id: "1"
  fetchType: STORE

- id: convertToCsv
  type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.IonToCsv
  from: "{{outputs.query.uri}}"

- id: convertBackToIon
  type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.CsvToIon
  from: "{{outputs.convertToCsv.uri}}""
```

### Processing data using scripts

Kestra can launch scripts written in Python, R, Node.js, Shell and Powershell. Depending on the `runner`, they can run directly in a local process on the host or inside Docker containers.

Those script tasks are available in the [Scripts Plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-scripts). Below is documentation for each of them:
- The [Python](/plugins/plugin-script-python/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.script) task runs a Python script in a Docker container or in a local process.
- The [Node](/plugins/plugin-script-node/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.node.script) task runs a Node.js script in a Docker container or in a local process.
- The [R](/plugins/plugin-script-r/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.script) task runs an R script in a Docker container or in a local process.
- The [Shell](/plugins/plugin-script-shell/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.script) task executes a single Shell command, or a list of commands that you provide.
- The [PowerShell](/plugins/plugin-script-powershell/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.powershell.script) task executes a single PowerShell command, or a list of commands that you provide.

The following example queries the BigQuery public dataset with Wikipedia page views to find the top 10 pages, convert it to CSV, and use the CSV file inside a Python task for further transformations using Pandas.

```yaml
id: wikipedia-top-ten-python-panda
namespace: company.team
description: analyze top 10 Wikipedia pages

tasks:
  - id: query
    type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery.Query
    sql: |
      SELECT DATETIME(datehour) as date, title, views FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_2023`
      WHERE DATE(datehour) = current_date() and wiki = 'en'
      ORDER BY datehour desc, views desc
      LIMIT 10
    store: true
    projectId: geller
    serviceAccount: "{{envs.gcp_creds}}"

  - id: write-csv
    type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.IonToCsv
    from: "{{outputs.query.uri}}"

  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    inputFiles:
      data.csv: "{{outputs['write-csv'].uri}}"
    tasks:
    - id: pandas
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
      warningOnStdErr: false
      containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
      script: |
        import pandas as pd
        from kestra import Kestra

        df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
        views = df['views'].sum()
        Kestra.outputs({'views': int(views)})
```

Kestra offers several plugins for ingesting and transforming data — check [the Plugin list](/plugins) for more details.

Make sure to also check:
1. The [Script documentation](../16.scripts/index.md) for a detailed overview of how to work with Python, R, Node.js, Shell and Powershell scripts, and how to integrate them with Git and Docker.
2. The [Blueprints](/blueprints) catalog — simply search for the relevant language (e.g., Python, R, Rust)  or use case (*ETL, Git, dbt, etc.*) to find the relevant examples.


### Processing data using file transform

Kestra can process data **row by row** using file transform tasks. The transformation is done with a small script written in Python, JavaScript, or Groovy.

- The [Jython FileTransform](/plugins/plugin-script-jython/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.jython.FileTransform) task allows transforming rows with Python.
- The [Nashorn FileTransform](/plugins/plugin-script-nashorn/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.nashorn.FileTransform) task allows transforming rows with JavaScript.
- The [Groovy FileTransform](/plugins/plugin-script-groovy/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.groovy.FileTransform) task allows transforming rows with Groovy.

The following example queries the BigQuery public dataset for Wikipedia pages, convert it row by row with the Nashorn FileTransform, and write it in a CSV file.

```yaml
id: wikipedia-top-ten-file-transform
namespace: company.team
description: A flow that loads wikipedia top 10 EN pages
tasks:
  - id: query-top-ten
    type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery.Query
    sql: |
      SELECT DATETIME(datehour) as date, title, views FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_2023`
      WHERE DATE(datehour) = current_date() and wiki = 'en'
      ORDER BY datehour desc, views desc
      LIMIT 10
    store: true

  - id: file-transform
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.nashorn.FileTransform
    from: "{{outputs['query-top-ten'].uri}}"
    script: |
      logger.info('row: {}', row)

      if (row['title'] === 'Main_Page' || row['title'] === 'Special:Search' || row['title'] === '-') {
        // remove un-needed row
        row = null
      } else {
        // add a 'time' column
        row['time'] = String(row['date']).substring(11)
        // modify the 'date' column to only keep the date part
        row['date'] = String(row['date']).substring(0, 10)
      }

  - id: write-csv
    type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.IonToCsv
    from: "{{outputs['file-transform'].uri}}"
```

::alert{type="info"}
The script can access a logger to log messages. Each row is available in a `row` variable where each column is accessible using the dictionary notation `row['columnName']`.

The [PurgeExecution](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purgeexecution) task can purge all the files stored inside the internal context by a flow execution.
It can be used at the end of a flow to purge all its generated files.

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: "purge-execution"
    type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeExecution"
```

The execution context itself is not available after the end of the execution and is automatically deleted from Kestra's repository after a retention period (seven days by default) that can be changed; see [configurations](../configuration/index.md).


Also, the [Purge](/plugins/core/tasks/storages/io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge) task can be used to purge storages, logs, and executions of previous execution. For example, this flow purges all of these every day:
```yaml
id: purge
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: "purge"
    type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge"
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 0 * * *"
```

## FAQ

### Internal Storage FAQ

#### How to read a file from the internal storage as a string?

The 'read' function expects an argument 'path' that is a path to a namespace file or an internal storage URI. Note that when using inputs, outputs or trigger variables, you don't need any extra quotation marks. Here is how you can use such variables along with the 'read' function:
- `{{ read(inputs.file) }}` for a FILE-type input variable named `file`
- `{{ read(outputs.mytaskid.uri) }}` for an output `uri` from a task named `mytaskid`
- `{{ read(trigger.uri) }}` for a `uri` of many triggers incl. Kafka, AWS SQS, GCP PubSub, etc.
- `{{ read(trigger.objects | jq('.[].uri')) }}` for a `uri` of a trigger that returns a list of detected objects, e.g. AWS S3, GCP GCS, etc.

Note that the read function can only read files within the same execution. If you try to read a file from a previous execution, you will get an Unauthorized error.


::collapse{title="Example using a FILE-type inputs variable"}
```yaml
id: read_file_as_string
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: file
    type: FILE

tasks:
  - id: log_internal_storage_uri
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ inputs.file }}"

  - id: log_file_content
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ read(inputs.file) }}"
```
::

::collapse{title="Example with the ForEachItem task reading file's content as a string"}
When using the `ForEachItem` task, you can use the `read()` function to read the content of a file as a string. This is especially useful when you want to pass the content of a file as a raw string as an input to a subflow.


Below is a simple subflow example that uses a string input:

```yaml
id: subflow_raw_string_input
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: string_input
    type: STRING
    defaults: hey there

tasks:
  - id: for_each_item
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ inputs.string_input }}"
```

Because the `ForEachItem` task splits the `items` file into batches of smaller files (one file per row by default), you can use the `read()` function to read the content of that file for a given batch as a string value and pass it as an input to that subflow shown above.

```yaml
id: parent_flow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    sql: |
      INSTALL httpfs;
      LOAD httpfs;
      SELECT *
      FROM read_csv_auto('https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv', header=True);
    store: true

  - id: each_raw
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"
    namespace: company.team
    flowId: subflow_raw_string_input
    inputs:
      string_input: "{{ read(taskrun.items) }}"
```

#### How to read a Namespace File as a string?

So far, you've seen how to read a file from the internal storage as a string. However, you can use the same `read()` function to read a Namespace File as a string. This is especially useful when you want to execute a Python script or a long SQL query stored in a dedicated SQL file.

The `read()` function takes the absolute path to the file you want to read. The path must point to a file stored in the **same namespace** as the flow you are executing.

Below is a simple example showing how you can read a file named `hello.py` stored in the `scripts` directory of the `company.team` namespace:

```yaml
id: hello
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: my_python_script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    script: "{{ read('scripts/hello.py') }}"
```

The same syntax applies to SQL queries, custom scripts, and many more. Check the [Namespace Files](../05.concepts/02.namespace-files.md) documentation for more details.

---

#### How to read a file from the internal storage as a JSON object?

You can use the Pebble function `{{ fromJson(myvar) }}` and a `{{ myvar | toJson }}` filter to process JSON data.

::collapse{title="The fromJson() function"}

The function is used to convert a string to a JSON object. For example, the following Pebble expression converts the string `{"foo": [666, 1, 2]}` to a JSON object and then returns the first value of the `foo` key, which is `42`:

```yaml
{{ json('{"foo": [42, 43, 44]}').foo[0] }}
```

You can use the `read()` function to read the content of a file as a string and then apply the `json()` function to convert it to a JSON object. Afterwards, you can read the value of a specific key in that JSON object. For example, the following Pebble expression reads the content of a file named `my.json` and then returns the value of the `foo` key, which is `42`:

```yaml
id: extract_json
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/json/app_events.json

  - id: read_as_string
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ read(outputs.extract.uri) }}"

  - id: read_as_json
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ json(read(outputs.extract.uri)) }}"

  - id: parse_json_elements
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ json(read(outputs.extract.uri)) | jq('map(.detail | fromjson | .message)') | first }}"
```

The above flow downloads a JSON file via an HTTP Request, reads its content as a string, converts it to a JSON object, and then in another task, it parses the JSON object and returns the value of a nested key.
::

::collapse{title="The json filter"}

You can use the `json` filter to convert any variable to a JSON string. You can think of it as a reverse process to what the `json()` function does.

The example below shows how you can convert a list of numbers to a JSON string `'[1, 2, 3]'` using the `| json` filter:

```yaml
{{ [1, 2, 3] | json }}
```

::alert{type="info"}
You typically would never used the `| json` filter in combination with the `read()` function. Anytime you need to read a file's content and then convert it to a JSON object, use a combination of the `read()` function and the `json()` function instead.
