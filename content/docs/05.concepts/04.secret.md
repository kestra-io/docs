Store sensitive information securely.

Secret is a mechanism that allows you to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, and retrieve them in your flows.

To retrieve secrets in a flow, use the `secret()` function, e.g. `"{{ secret('API_TOKEN'') }}"`. You can leverage your existing secrets manager as a secrets backend.

Your flows often need to interact with external systems. To do that, they need to programmatically authenticate using passwords or API keys. Secrets help you securely store such variables and avoid hard-coding sensitive information within your workflow code.

You can leverage the `secret()` function, described in the [function section](/docs/concepts/expression/function#secret), to retrieve sensitive variables within your flow code.


## Secrets in the Enterprise Edition

### Adding a new Secret from the UI

If you are using a managed Kestra version, you can add **new Secrets** directly from the UI. In the left navigation menu, go to **Namespaces**, select the namespace to which you want to add a new secret. Then, add a new secret within the Secrets tab.

![Secrets EE](/docs/developer-guide/secrets/secrets-ee-1.png)

Here, we add a new secret with a key `MY_SECRET`:

### Secret Management backends

Kestra [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise) provides additional secret management backends and integrations with secrets managers. See the [Secrets Manager](../06.enterprise/secrets-manager.md) page for more details.

## Secrets in the Open-Source version

When using the open-source version, sensitive variables can be managed using base64-encoded environment variables. The section below demonstrates several ways to encode those values and use them in your Kestra instance.

### Manual encoding using a CLI command

Imagine that so far, you were setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export MYPASSWORD=myPrivateCode
```

Here is how you can encode the sensitive value of that environment variable:

```bash
echo -n "myPrivateCode" | base64
```

This should output the value: `bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==`.

To use that value as a Secret in your Kestra instance, you would need to add a prefix `SECRET_` to the variable key (here: `SECRET_MYPASSWORD`) and set that key to the encoded value:

```bash
export SECRET_MYPASSWORD=bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==
```

If you would add the environment variable to the `kestra` container section in a [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml#L22), it would look as follows:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    environment:
      SECRET_MYPASSWORD: bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==
```

This secret can then be used in a flow using the `{{ secret('SECRET_MYPASSWORD') }}` syntax, and it will base64-decoded during flow execution. Note that to reference any non_encoded environment variables, you can always use the syntax `{{envs.lowercase_environment_variable_key}}` instead.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that Kestra has built-in protection to prevent logs from revealing any encoded secret you would have defined and passed to it.
::

> Make sure to add your custom environment variables *before* starting Kestra. Environment variables are loaded at the JVM startup, so adding new variables or modifying existing ones requires restarting your instance. To manage such changes without downtime, you can either try the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise) or restart your server during a planned maintenance window.

> **Note** that we do not include the prefix `SECRET_` when calling the `secret('MYPASSWORD')` function. The prefix is only required as a name of the environment variable to ensure that Kestra is only looking for the relevant environment variables without loading unnecessary system variables. This improves both performance and security as it ensures that Kestra only reads environment variables that are needed.

### Convert all variables in an `.env` file

The previous section showed the process for one Secret. But what if you have tens or hundreds of them? This is where `.env` file can come in handy.

Let's assume that you have an `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
MYPASSWORD=password
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=mypat
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myawsaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=myawssecretaccesskey

```

Make sure to keep the last line empty, otherwise the bash script below won't encode the last secret AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY correctly.

Using the bash script shown below, you can:
1. Encode all values using base64-encoding
2. Add a `SECRET_` prefix to all environment variable names
3. Store the result as `.env_encoded`

```bash
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
    echo "SECRET_$key=$(echo -n "$value" | base64)";
done < .env > .env_encoded
```

The `.env_encoded` file should look as follows:

```bash
SECRET_MYPASSWORD=cGFzc3dvcmQ=
SECRET_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=bXlwYXQ=
SECRET_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=bXlhd3NhY2Nlc3NrZXk=
SECRET_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bXlhd3NzZWNyZXRhY2Nlc3NrZXk=
```

Then, in your Docker Compose file, you can replace:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
```

with the encoded version of the file:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    env_file:
      - .env_encoded
```


### Use a macro within your `.env` file

As an alternative to replacing values in your environment variables by encoded counterparts, you may also leverage the `base64encode` macro and keep the values intact.

The original `.env` file:

```bash
MYPASSWORD=password
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=mypat
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myawsaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=myawssecretaccesskey
```

can be modified to the following format:

```bash
SECRET_MYPASSWORD={{ "password" | base64encode }}
SECRET_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN={{ "mypat" | base64encode }}
SECRET_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={{ "myawsaccesskey" | base64encode }}
SECRET_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={{ "myawssecretaccesskey" | base64encode }}
```
