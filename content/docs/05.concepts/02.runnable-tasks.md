title: Runnable Tasks

Runnable tasks are data processing tasks incl. file system operations, API calls, database queries, etc. These tasks can be compute-intensive and are processed by workers.

Each task must have an identifier (id) and a type. The type is the task's Java Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN).

Tasks have properties specific to the type of the task; check each task's documentation for the list of available properties.

Most available tasks are Runnable Tasks except special ones that are [Flowable Tasks](../05.concepts/01.flowable-tasks.md).

By default, Kestra only includes a few Runnable Tasks. However, many of them are available as [plugins](/plugins), and if you use our default Docker image, plenty of them will already be included.

## Example

In this example, we have 2 Runnable Tasks: one which makes a HTTP request and another that logs the output of that request.

```yaml
id: runnable_http
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: make_request
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: https://reqres.in/api/products
    method: GET
    contentType: application/json

  - id: print_status
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ outputs.make_request.body }}"
```
