Runnable tasks are data processing tasks incl. file system operations, API calls, database queries, etc. These tasks can be compute-intensive and are processed by workers.

Each task must have an identifier (id) and a type. The type is the task's Java Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN).

Tasks have properties specific to the type of the task; check each task's documentation for the list of available properties.

Most available tasks are Runnable Tasks except special ones that are [Flowable Tasks](./01.flowable-tasks.md); those are explained later on this page.

By default, Kestra only includes a few Runnable Tasks. However, many of them are available as [plugins](https://kestra.io/plugins), and if you use our default Docker image, plenty of them will already be included.
