Run tasks as AWS ECS Fargate or EC2 containers using AWS Batch.

To launch tasks on AWS Batch, there are three main concepts you need to be aware of:
1. **Compute environment** — mandatory, it won't be created by the task.  The compute environment is the infrastructure type for your tasks. It can be either an ECS Fargate or EC2 environment.
2. **Job Queue** — optional, it will be created by the task if not specified. Creating a queue takes some time to set up, so be aware that this adds some latency to the script’s runtime.
3. **Job** — created by the task runner; holds information about which image, commands, and resources to run on. In AWS ECS terminology, it’s the task definition for the ECS task.

To get started quickly, follow the instructions from [this blueprint](https://kestra.io/blueprints/225-run-multiple-python-scripts-in-parallel-on-aws-ecs-fargate-with-aws-batch) to provision all resources required to run containers on ECS Fargate.

#### How does it work

In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the AWS Batch task runner currently relies on [multi-containers ECS jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-container-jobs.html) and creates three containers for each job:
1. A _before_-container that uploads input files to S3.
2. The _main_ container that fetches input files into the `{{ workingDir }}` directory and runs the task.
3. An _after_-container that fetches output files using `outputFiles` to make them available from the Kestra UI for download and preview.

Since we don't know the working directory of the container in advance, we always need to explicitly define the working directory and output directory when using the AWS Batch runner, e.g. use `cat {{workingDir}}/myFile.txt` rather than `cat myFile.txt`.

##  How to Run Tasks on AWS ECS Fargate
How to use `AwsBatchScriptRunner` to run your tasks on AWS ECS Fargate.

### Before you begin

Before you start, you need to have the following:
1. An AWS account.
2. A running Kestra instance in a version 0.16.0 or later with AWS credentials stored as [secrets](../../04.secret.md) or environment variables within the Kestra instance.

There are two versions of this tutorial:
- Terraform: provision all necessary resources using a simple ``terraform apply`` command.
- AWS Management Console: create the necessary resources step by step from the AWS Console.

---

### Terraform setup

Follow the instructions specified in the [aws-batch/README.md](https://github.com/kestra-io/terraform-deployments/tree/main/aws-batch) within the [terraform-deployments](https://github.com/kestra-io/terraform-deployments) repository to provision all necessary resources using Terraform. You can also use [the following blueprint](https://kestra.io/blueprints/225-run-multiple-python-scripts-in-parallel-on-aws-ecs-fargate-with-aws-batch) that will create all necessary resources for you as part of a single Kestra workflow execution.


Here is a list of resources that will be created:
- **AWS Security Group:** a security group for AWS Batch jobs with egress to the internet (required to be able to download public Docker images in your script tasks).
- **AWS IAM Roles and Policies:** IAM roles and policies for AWS Batch and ECS Task Execution, including permissions for S3 access (S3 is used to store input and output files for container access).
- **AWS Batch Compute Environment:** a managed ECS Fargate compute environment named `kestraFargateEnvironment`.
- **AWS Batch Job Queue:** a job queue named `kestraJobQueue` for submitting batch jobs.

---

### AWS Management Console setup

#### Create the `ecsTaskExecutionRole` IAM role

To use AWS Batch, we need an Execution Role that will allow AWS Batch to create and manage resources on our behalf.

1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.
3. Choose **Create role**.
4. In the **Select trusted entity**, choose **Custom trust policy** and paste the following `Trust policy JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
   ![iam](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch1.png)
5. Click on **Next** twice. Then, for **Role Name**, enter `ecsTaskExecutionRole`
6. Finally, click on **Create role**.

![create_role](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch2.png)


Make sure to copy the ARN of the role. You will need it later.

![role_arn](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch3.png)

#### AWS Batch setup

Go to the AWS Batch console.

![img.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch4_search.png)

Then, click on "Get Started". If you don't see the "Get Started" button, add `#firstRun` to the URL:

![img.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch4_firstrun.png)

This will launch a Wizard that will guide you through the process of creating a new compute environment.

![img.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch4_jobtype.png)

You should see the following text recommending the use of Fargate:

> "We recommend using Fargate in most scenarios. Fargate launches and scales the compute to closely match the resource requirements that you specify for the container. With Fargate, you don't need to over-provision or pay for additional servers. You also don't need to worry about the specifics of infrastructure-related parameters such as instance type. When the compute environment needs to be scaled up, jobs that run on Fargate resources can get started more quickly. Typically, it takes a few minutes to spin up a new Amazon EC2 instance. However, jobs that run on Fargate can be provisioned in about 30 seconds. The exact time required depends on several factors, including container image size and number of jobs. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/fargate.html)."

We will follow that advice and use Fargate for this tutorial.

#### Step 1: Select Orchestration type

Select Fargate and click on Next.

#### Step 2: Create a compute environment

Add a name for your compute environment — here, we chose "kestra". You can keep the default settings for everything. Select the VPC and subnets you want to use — you can use the default VPC and subnets and the default VPC security group. Then, click on Next.

![img_2.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch5.png)

#### Step 3: Create a job queue

Now we can create a job queue. Here, we also name it "kestra". You can keep the default settings. Then, click on Next:

![img_3.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch6.png)

#### Step 4: Create a job definition

Finally, create a job definition. Here, we name it also "kestra". Under Execution role, select the role we created earlier (`ecsTaskExecutionRole`). Besides that, you can keep default settings for everything else (we adjusted the image to ``ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest`` but that's totally optional). Then, click on Next:

![img_7.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch7.png)

#### Step 5: Create a job

Finally, create a job. Here, we name it "kestra". Then, click on Next for a final review:

![img_4.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch8.png)

#### Step 6: Review and create

Review your settings and click on Create resources:

![img_8.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch9.png)

Once you see this message, you are all set:

![img_9.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch10.png)

#### Copy and apply the ARN to your Kestra configuration

Copy the ARN of the compute environment and job queue. You will need to add these to your Kestra configuration.

![img_10.png](/docs/concepts/taskrunner-aws-batch/batch11.png)

### Run your Kestra task on AWS ECS Fargate

Fill in the ARNs of the compute environment and job queue in your Kestra configuration. Here is an example of a flow that uses the `AwsBatchScriptRunner` to run a Python script on AWS ECS Fargate:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: send_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.runner.Batch
      computeEnvironmentArn: arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789:compute-environment/kestra
      jobQueueArn: arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789:job-queue/kestra
      region: us-east-1
      accessKeyId: "{{ secrets.awsAccessKey }}"
      secretKeyId: "{{ secrets.awsSecretKey }}"
      executionRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole
      bucket: kestra-us
    script: |
      import platform
      import socket
      import sys

      print("Hello from AWS Batch and kestra!")

      def print_environment_info():
          print(f"Host's network name: {platform.node()}")
          print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
          print(f"Platform information (instance type): {platform.platform()}")
          print(f"OS/Arch: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}")

          try:
              hostname = socket.gethostname()
              ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
              print(f"Host IP Address: {ip_address}")
          except socket.error as e:
              print("Unable to obtain IP address.")


      if __name__ == '__main__':
          print_environment_info()
```
