title: Azure Batch Task Runner
icon: /docs/icons/dev.svg
version: ">= 0.16.0"
---

Run tasks as containers on Azure Batch VMs.

This runner will deploy the container for the task to a specified Azure Batch pool.

To launch the task on Azure Batch, there is only two main concepts you need to be aware of:
1. **Pool** — mandatory, not created by the task. This is a pool composed of nodes where your task can run on.
2. **Job** — created by the task runner; holds information about which image, commands, and resources to run on.

#### How does it work

In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the Azure Batch task runner currently relies on [resource files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/resource-files) and [output files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchservice/task/add?view=rest-batchservice-2023-11-01&tabs=HTTP) which transit through [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs).

As with Process and Docker task runners, you can directly reference input, namespace and output files since you're in the same working directory: `cat myFile.txt`.

#### A full flow example

```yaml
id: azure_batch_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: scrape_environment_info
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.azure.runner.Batch
      account: "{{secrets.account}}"
      accessKey: "{{secrets.accessKey}}"
      endpoint: "{{secrets.endpoint}}"
      poolId: "{{vars.poolId}}"
      blobStorage:
        containerName: "{{vars.containerName}}"
        connectionString: "{{secrets.connectionString}}"
    commands:
      - python main.py
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    outputFiles:
      - "environment_info.json"
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        import platform
        import socket
        import sys
        import json
        from kestra import Kestra

        print("Hello from Azure Batch and kestra!")

        def print_environment_info():
            print(f"Host's network name: {platform.node()}")
            print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
            print(f"Platform information (instance type): {platform.platform()}")
            print(f"OS/Arch: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}")

            env_info = {
                "host": platform.node(),
                "platform": platform.platform(),
                "OS": sys.platform,
                "python_version": platform.python_version(),
            }
            Kestra.outputs(env_info)

            filename = 'environment_info.json'
            with open(filename, 'w') as json_file:
                json.dump(env_info, json_file, indent=4)

        if __name__ == '__main__':
          print_environment_info()
```
