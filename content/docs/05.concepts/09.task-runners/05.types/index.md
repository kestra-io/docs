This section lists all task runners available in Kestra.


The Process task runner is located within the core repository. Additionally, the Docker task runner is included in the `plugin-script` repository â€” by default, Kestra runs all script tasks in Docker.

Other plugins such as the AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes plugins provide additional task runners for their respective environments. Each `taskRunner` is identified by its `type`.
