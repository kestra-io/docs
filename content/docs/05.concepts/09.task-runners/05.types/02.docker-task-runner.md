Run tasks as Docker containers.

Here is an example using the `DockerTaskRunner` executing the commands in a Docker container:

```yaml
id: docker_script_runner
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    containerImage: centos
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

Once you specify the `taskRunner` type, you get the autocompletion and validation for the runner-specific properties. In the example above, the task allocates 1 CPU to the container.

The only property required by the `taskRunner` is the `containerImage` property that needs to be set on the script task. The image can be from a public or private registry. Additionally, using the `DockerTaskRunner` you can configure memory allocation, volumes, environment variables, and more. For a full list of properties available in the `DockerTaskRunner`, check the [Docker plugin documentation](/plugins/plugin-script-python/task-runners/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner) or explore the same in the built-in Code Editor in the Kestra UI.

::alert{type="info"}
The `DockerTaskRunner` executes the script task as a container in a Docker-compatible engine. This means that you can also use it to run scripts within a Kubernetes  cluster with Docker-In-Docker (dind) or in a local Docker engine.

Also, keep in mind that if a Kestra Worker executing the script is terminated (e.g. due to a crash), the container will still run until completion. When running Kestra itself in a container with Docker-In-Docker (dind), both the worker and container will be restarted.
