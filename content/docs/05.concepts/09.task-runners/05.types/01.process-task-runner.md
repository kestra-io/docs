Run tasks as local processes.

Here is an example of a Shell script configured with the Process task runner which runs a Shell command as a child process in the Kestra host:

```yaml
id: process_script_runner
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

The Process task runner doesn’t have any additional configuration beyond the `type` property.
