Task Runners is an extensible, pluggable system capable of executing your tasks in arbitrary remote environments.

Many data processing tasks are **computationally intensive** and require a lot of resources (_such as CPU, GPU, and memory_). Instead of provisioning always-on servers, Task Runners can execute your code on **dynamically provisioned compute instances** in the cloud, such as AWS ECS Fargate, Azure Batch, Google Batch, auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters, and more.

All you have to do to offload your task execution to a remote environment is to specify the `taskRunner` type in your task configuration. Each `type` of a task runner is a **plugin** with its own schema. The built-in code editor provides documentation, autocompletion, and syntax validation for all task runner plugin properties to ensure correctness, standardization, and consistency.

Note that some task runner plugins are available only in the [Enterprise Edition](../../06.enterprise/index.md). If you want to try them out, please [reach out](/demo/).
