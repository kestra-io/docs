Task Runner capabilities and supported plugins.

## Task Runners Capabilities

Task Runners offer a powerful way to offload compute-intensive tasks to remote environments. The table below highlights their capabilities.

| Capability                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fine-grained resource allocation**     | Task Runners give you full control over the compute resources — you can flexibly choose how much CPU, memory, or GPU you want to allocate to specific tasks.                                                              |
| **Flexible deployment patterns**         | Task Runners support various deployment models, including AWS ECS Fargate, Azure Batch, Google Batch, Kubernetes, and more. You can mix and match different runners even within a single workflow.                        |
| **No vendor lock-in**                    | Task Runners are built on top of a plugin ecosystem, so you can run your code on any cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure without being locked to a specific vendor or deployment model.                          |
| **Task isolation**                       | Your tasks run in fully isolated container environments without interfering with each other or competing for resources.                                                                                                   |
| **Made for development and production**  | You can develop your code locally in Docker containers and run the same code in a production environment on a Kubernetes cluster. Thanks to task runners, setting this up is as simple as changing a single property.     |
| **Centralized configuration management** | Task Runners make it easy to centrally govern your configuration. For example, you can use `pluginDefaults` on a namespace level to manage your task runner configuration and credentials in a single place.                |
| **Documentation and autocompletion**     | Each task runner is a plugin with its own schema. The built-in code editor provides documentation, autocompletion and syntax validation for all runner properties to ensure correctness, standardization and consistency. |
| **No changes to your code**              | You can run the same business logic in different environments without changing anything in your code.                                                                                                                     |
| **Fully customizable**                   | If you need more customization, you can create your own Task Runner plugin to match your specific deployment patterns.                                                                                                    |

## Plugins Supporting Task Runners
Task Runners are intended to be used in the tasks from the [Script Plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-scripts) and its sub-plugins tasks, including:
- [Python](/plugins/plugin-script-python)
- [Node](/plugins/plugin-script-node)
- [Shell](/plugins/plugin-script-shell)
- [PowerShell](/plugins/plugin-script-powershell)
- [R](/plugins/plugin-script-r)
- [Julia](/plugins/plugin-script-julia)
- [Ruby](/plugins/plugin-script-ruby)
- [dbt](/plugins/plugin-dbt)
- [Singer](/plugins/plugin-singer)
- [SQLMesh](/plugins/plugin-sqlmesh)
- [Ansible](/plugins/plugin-ansible)
- [Terraform](/plugins/plugin-terraform)
- [Modal](/plugins/plugin-modal)
- [AWS CLI](/plugins/plugin-aws/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.aws.cli.awscli)
- [GCloud CLI](/plugins/plugin-gcp/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.cli.gcloudcli)
- [Azure CLI](/plugins/plugin-azure/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.azure.cli.azcli)

Anytime you see a task that can execute a `script` or a series of `commands`, it's a script task that contains a `taskRunner` property.
