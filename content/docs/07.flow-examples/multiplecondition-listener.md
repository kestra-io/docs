title: Multiple condition listener
---

This flow will start only if `multiplecondition-flow-a` and `multiplecondition-flow-b` are successful during the last 24h. You need the two flows [multiplecondition-flow-a](/examples/flows_multiplecondition-flow-a.yml) and [multiplecondition-flow-b](/examples/flows_multiplecondition-flow-b.yml) for it to work.

```yaml file=public/examples/flows_multiplecondition-listeners.yml
```
