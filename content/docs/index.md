title: Welcome to Kestra
---

Kestra is an open-source **infinitely-scalable orchestration platform** enabling all engineers to manage **business-critical workflows** declaratively in code.

Thanks to the hundreds of [built-in plugins](/plugins) and embedded VS code editor with Git and Terraform integrations, Kestra makes scheduled and event-driven data pipelines easy.

Follow the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/getting-started/) to install Kestra and start orchestrating your first workflows. Then, explore our [Tutorial](03.tutorial/index.md), [Blueprints](https://kestra.io/blueprints), and [Concept docs](07.concepts/index.md) to build more advanced workflows and [deploy Kestra](02.installation/index.md) to your preferred environment.
