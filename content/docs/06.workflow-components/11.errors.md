There are multiple ways to handle errors in Kestra, to both help you identify them and allow flows to continue to operate despite errors.

## `errors` Component

`errors` is a list of tasks set on a flow level that will be executed when an error occurs. You can add multiple tasks, and they will be executed sequentially. This is useful for sending alerts when errors occur.

The example below sends a flow-level failure alert via Slack using the [SlackIncomingWebhook](/plugins/plugin-notifications/tasks/slack/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.slackincomingwebhook) task defined using the `errors` property.


```yaml file=public/examples/flows_errors_1.yaml
```

## `allowFailure` Property

When you execute a flow and one of the tasks fail, it will no longer proceed stopping later tasks from executing. This can be annoying if the task that failed doesn't impact other tasks, such as sending a message or a log output. We can resolve this by adding the `allowFailure` property to our task which will let it continue and pass the execution as `WARNING` in the Logs.

```yaml file=public/examples/flows_allow-failure.yml
