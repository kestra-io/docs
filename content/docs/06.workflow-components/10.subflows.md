Subflows allow you to build **modular** and **reusable** workflow components. They work similarly to calling functions. A subflow execution is created when you call a flow from other flow.

## How to declare a subflow

To call a flow from another flow, use the `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Subflow` task and in that task, specify the `flowId` and `namespace` of the subflow that you want to execute. Optionally, you can also specify custom `input` values, in the same way as you would pass arguments in a function call.

The optional properties `wait` and `transmitFailed` control the execution behavior. By default, if `wait` is not set or set to false, the parent flow continues execution without waiting for the subflow's completion. The `transmitFailed` property determines whether a failure in the subflow execution should cause the parent flow to fail.

## Practical Example

Consider a subflow that encapsulates critical business logic. This subflow can be called from various flows, allowing for code reuse and isolated testing.

Here is a simple example of a subflow:

```yaml
id: critical_service
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: return_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    sql: |
      INSTALL httpfs;
      LOAD httpfs;
      SELECT sum(total) as total, avg(quantity) as avg_quantity
      FROM read_csv_auto('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/datasets/main/csv/orders.csv', header=True);
    store: true
```

In this example, `return_data` outputs `uri` of the query output. That URI is a reference to the Internal Storage location of the stored file. This output can be used in the parent flow to perform further processing.

```yaml
id: parent_service
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: subflow_call
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Subflow
    namespace: dev
    flowId: critical_service
    wait: true
    transmitFailed: true
    # output data from a specific subflow task called return_data
    outputs:
      some_output: "{{outputs.return_data.uri}}"

  - id: log_subflow_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - cat "{{ outputs.subflow_call.outputs.some_output }}"
```

The `outputs` map task IDs to their outputs. In this case, we are accessing the `outputs.some_output` output of the `subflow_call` task.

## Subflow properties

Below is a full list of all properties of the `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Subflow` task. Don't worry, **you don't need to memorize them all**, you can always open the task documentation to see the full list of Subflow task properties:

| Field            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `flowId`         | The subflow's identifier.                                                   |
| `namespace`      | The namespace where the subflow is located.                                 |
| `inheritLabels`  | Determines if the subflow inherits labels from the parent (default: false). |
| `inputs`         | Inputs passed to the subflow.                                               |
| `labels`         | Labels assigned to the subflow.                                             |
| `outputs`        | Allows passing outputs from the subflow execution to the parent flow.       |
| `revision`       | The subflow revision to execute (defaults to the latest).                   |
| `wait`           | If true, parent flow waits for subflow completion (default: false).         |
| `transmitFailed` | If true, parent flow fails on subflow failure (requires `wait` to be true). |


## Outputs from a subflow execution

Outputs include the execution ID, extracted outputs, and the final state (if `wait` is true). This modular approach improves maintainability and code reuse in complex workflows.

To sum up, subflows improve maintainability of complex workflows. They allow you to build modular and reusable workflow components and share them across multiple namespaces, projects, and teams.
