Tasks are the steps within a flow.

Tasks are discrete actions within a flow, capable of taking inputs and variables from the flow, and producing outputs for downstream consumption by end users and other tasks.

## Flowable Tasks

Kestra orchestrates your flows using [Flowable Tasks](/docs/concepts/flowable-tasks). These tasks do not perform any heavy computation. Instead, they control the orchestration behavior, allowing you to implement more advanced workflow patterns.

Example Flowable tasks include:
- `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Parallel`
- `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Switch`
- `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.ForEachItem`

Read the full list on the [Flowable tasks page](/docs/concepts/flowable-tasks).

## Runnable Tasks

In Kestra, most data processing workloads are executed using [Runnable Tasks](/docs/concepts/runnable-tasks).

In contrast to Flowable Tasks, Runnable Tasks are responsible for performing the actual work. For example, file system operations, API calls, database queries, etc. These tasks can be compute-intensive and are handled by [workers](../04.architecture/05.worker.md).

Example runnable tasks include:
- `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands`
- `io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.Request`
- `io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackExecution`

## Core task properties

The table below lists the core task properties available to all tasks.

| `logLevel`        | To define the log level granularity for which logs will be inserted into the backend database. By default, all logs are stored. However, if you restrict that to e.g., the `INFO` level, all lower log levels such as `DEBUG` and TRACE won't be persisted. |

## Dynamic vs. static task properties

Task properties can be **static** or **dynamic**. Dynamic task properties can be set using expressions. To find out whether a given task property is static or dynamic, check the task documentation available on the [plugin's homepage](https://kestra.io/plugins) as well as in the UI when you hover over a task and click on the documentation tab on the right.

![dynamic_properties](/docs/concepts/dynamic_properties.png)

Often some task properties are marked as **not dynamic** because they are complex types (e.g. maps, list of strings, list of maps), meaning that they are **placeholders** for other dynamic properties. Let's take the [runTasks](https://kestra.io/plugins/tasks/job/io.kestra.plugin.databricks.job.SubmitRun#runtasks) property of Databrick's `SubmitRun` task as an example. This property is not dynamic because it's an array of [RunSubmitTaskSetting](https://kestra.io/plugins/tasks/job/io.kestra.plugin.databricks.job.SubmitRun#runsubmittasksetting). 

On top of that, `RunSubmitTaskSetting` is a group of other properties which are also either dynamic or of complex type (placeholder for other properties). It's therefore useful to always drill down to the lowest level — most properties at the lowest level are dynamic and can be templated using expressions.
