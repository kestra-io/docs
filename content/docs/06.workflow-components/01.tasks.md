Tasks are discrete actions within a flow, capable of taking inputs and variables from the flow, and producing outputs for downstream consumption by end users and other tasks.

## Flowable Tasks

Kestra orchestrates your flows using [Flowable Tasks](../07.concepts/01.flowable-tasks.md). These tasks do not perform any heavy computation. Instead, they control the orchestration behavior, allowing you to implement more advanced workflow patterns.

## Runnable Tasks

In Kestra, most data processing workloads are executed using [Runnable Tasks](../07.concepts/02.runnable-tasks.md).

In contrast to Flowable Tasks, Runnable Tasks are responsible for performing the actual work. For example, file system operations, API calls, database queries, etc. These tasks can be compute-intensive and are handled by [workers](../04.architecture/05.worker.md).

## Core task properties

The table below lists the core task properties available to all tasks.

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `timeout`         | Task timeout expressed in [ISO 8601 Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).                                                                                                                                                           |
| `disabled`        | Set it to `true` to disable execution of the task.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `logLevel`        | To define the log level granularity for which logs will be inserted into the backend database. By default, all logs are stored. However, if you restrict that to e.g., the `INFO` level, all lower log levels such as `DEBUG` and TRACE won't be persisted. |
| `allowFailure`    | Boolean flag allowing to continue the execution even if this task fails.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Dynamic vs. static task properties

Task properties can be **static** or **dynamic**. Dynamic task properties can be set using epressions. To find out whether a given task property is static or dynamic, check the task documentation available on the [plugin's homepage](https://kestra.io/plugins) as well as in the UI when you hover over a task and click on the documentation tab on the right.

Often some task properties are marked as **not dynamic** because they are of complex types (e.g. maps, list of strings, list of maps), meaning that they are **placeholders** for other dynamic properties. Let's take the [runTasks](https://kestra.io/plugins/tasks/job/io.kestra.plugin.databricks.job.SubmitRun#runtasks) property of Databrick's `SubmitRun` task as an example. This property is not dynamic because it's an array of [RunSubmitTaskSetting](https://kestra.io/plugins/tasks/job/io.kestra.plugin.databricks.job.SubmitRun#runsubmittasksetting). This `RunSubmitTaskSetting` in turn is a group of multiple other properties which are also either dynamic or of complex type (placeholder for other properties). It's therefore useful to always drill down to the lowest level â€” most lowest level properties are dynamic and can be templated using epressions.
