Retries handle transient failures in your workflows. 

They are defined at the task level and can be configured to retry a task a certain number of times, or with a certain delay between each retry.

## What are retries

Kestra provides a task retry functionality. This makes it possible to add retry behavior for any **failed task run** based on configurations in the flow description.

A retry on a task run will create a new task run attempt.

### Example

The following example defines a retry for the `retry-sample` task with a maximum of 5 attempts every 15 minutes:

```yaml
- id: retry-sample
  type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
  message: my output for task {{task.id}}
  timeout: PT10M
  retry:
    type: constant
    maxAttempt: 5
    interval: PT15M
```

In next example, the flow will be retried four times every 0.25 ms, with each attempt executing for a maximum of 1 minute before being failed. 

Due to the shell command logic, it will succeed at the 5th attempt as we can track how many times it retries with `{{ taskrun.attemptsCount }}`

```yaml file=public/examples/flows_retry.yml
```

### Retry options for all retry types

| name             | type       | description                                                                         |
|------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`           | `string`   | Retry behavior to apply. Can be one of `constant`, `exponential`, `random`.         |
| `maxAttempt`     | `integer`  | Number of retries performed before the system stops retrying.                       |
| `maxDuration`    | `Duration` | Maximum delay the execution is retried. Once passed, the task is no more processed. |
| `warningOnRetry` | `Boolean`  | Flag the execution as warning if any retry was done on this task. Default `false`.  |

### Duration

Some options above have to be filled with a duration notation.
Durations are expressed in [ISO 8601 Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations), here are some examples:

| name     | description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| PT0.250S | 250 milliseconds delay   |
| PT2S     | 2 seconds delay          |
| PT1M     | 1 minute delay           |
| PT3.5H   | 3 hours and a half delay |

## Retry types


### `constant`
This establishes constant retry times: if the `interval` property is set to 10 minutes, it retries every 10 minutes.

| name       | type       | description                  |
|------------|------------|------------------------------|
| `interval` | `Duration` | Duration between each retry. |

### `exponential`
This establishes retry behavior that waits longer between each retry e.g. 1s, 5s, 15s, ...

| name          | type       | description                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `interval`    | `Duration` | Duration between each retry.                                                                                                                                          |
| `maxInterval` | `Duration` | Max Duration between each retry.                                                                                                                                      |
| `delayFactor` | `Double`   | Multiplier for the `interval` on between retry, default is 2. For example, with an interval of 30s and a delay factor of 2, retry will append at 30s, 1m30, 3m30, ... |

### `random`
This establishes retries with a random delay within minimum and maximum limits.

| name          | type       | description                          |
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `minInterval` | `Duration` | Minimal duration between each retry. |
| `maxInterval` | `Duration` | Maximum duration between each retry. |

## Configuring retries globally

You can also configure retries globally for all tasks in a flow by using the `plugins` [configuration](../10.configuration-guide/plugins.md):

```yaml
kestra:
  plugins:
    configurations:
      - type: io.kestra
        values:
          retry:
            type: constant
            maxAttempt: 3
            interval: PT30S
```

This configuration will apply a constant retry with a maximum of 3 attempts every 30 seconds to all tasks across all flows.

## Retry vs. Restart vs. Replay

### Automatic vs. manual

**Retries** ensure that failed task runs are *automatically* rerun within the *same Execution*. Apart from retries, defined within your flow code, you can also *manually* rerun the flow from the Flow Execution page in the UI using the **Restart** or **Replay** buttons.

![replay_restart.png](/docs/developer-guide/failure/replay_restart.png)

### Restart vs. Replay

While **Restart** will rerun failed tasks within the current Execution (*i.e., without creating a new execution*), a **Replay** would result in a completely new run with a different Execution ID than the initial run.

![replay.png](/docs/developer-guide/failure/replay.png)

When you replay an Execution, a new execution gets created for the same flow. However, you can still track which Execution triggered this new run thanks to the `Original Execution` field:

![original_execution.png](/docs/developer-guide/failure/original_execution.png)

Replay can be executed from any task, even if that task executed successfully.
But note that when you trigger a replay from a specific failed task, it will still result in a new Execution running all tasks downstream of your chosen start task:

![replay_task.png](/docs/developer-guide/failure/replay_task.png)

When you want to rerun only failed tasks, use `Restart`.


### Summary: Retries vs. Restart vs. Replay

The table below summarizes the differences between a retry, restart and replay.

| Concept | Flow or task level        | Automatic or manual | Does it create a new execution?                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retry   | Task level                | Automatic           | No, it only reruns a given task within the same Execution. Each retry results in a new attempt number, allowing you to see how many times a given task run was retried.                             |
| Restart | Flow level                | Manual              | No, it only reruns all failed tasks within the same Execution. It's meant to handle unanticipated, transient failures. The UI shows a new attempt number for all task runs that were restarted.     |
| Replay  | Either flow or task level | Manual              | Yes. You can pick an arbitrary step from which a new execution should be triggered. If you select a task in the middle that needs outputs from a previous task, its output is retrieved from cache. |
