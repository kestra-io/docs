## Setup an Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. To create an Azure Devops Pipeline, first connect to your code repository. You can choose from several providers such as GitHub, Azure Repos Git or Bitbucket.

2. Then, choose the repository where your Kestra flows are located.


3. Start with a minimal pipeline template or use an existing one.

4. Consider the following pipeline:

```yaml
trigger:
 branches:
   include:
     - main

pool:
  name: test-pool

stages:

  - stage: tfvalidate
    jobs:
      - job: deploy
        continueOnError: false
        steps:

          - task: TerraformInstaller@1
            inputs:
              terraformVersion: 'latest'

          - task: TerraformTaskV4@4
            inputs:
              provider: 'aws'
              command: 'init'
              backendServiceAWS: 'aws_s3'
              backendAWSBucketName: 'eu-north-1'
              backendAWSKey: 'kestra-tf'
              
          - task: TerraformTaskV4@4
            inputs:
              provider: 'aws'
              command: 'validate'
              
          - task: TerraformTaskV4@4
            inputs:
              provider: 'aws'
              command: 'apply'
              environmentServiceNameAWS: 'aws_s3'
```

- The pipeline is triggered whenever the `main` branch is updated, so when you merge a PR into the `main` branch, the pipeline will run
 
- Choose a pool created beforehand. Check the [official Azure DevOps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml,browser) to create and manage agent pools

- Use the Terraform extension to install, validate, and apply Terraform resources. You can install the Terraform extension task by navigating to the Organization Settings > Extensions and then browse the marketplace to install the Terraform extension.

The first task is to use the `TerraformInstaller@1` to install Terraform when the pipeline runs. Then, we use the `TerraformTaskV4@4`` three times:

1. run the `init`` command. Here, we use an AWS S3 bucket for the Terraform backend, but you can use either Azure RM backend, AWS, or GCP

2. run the `validate`` command, which will check whether the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent

3. run the `apply`` command to execute the actions proposed in the Terraform plan
