title: Filter
---

Variables can be modified by filters. Filters are separated from the variable name by a pipe symbol `|`. Multiple filters can be chained. The output of one filter is applied to the next.

The following example removes all HTML tags from the name and title-cases it:
```twig
{{ name  |title }}
```

Filters that accept arguments have parentheses around the arguments. This example joins the elements of a list with commas:
```twig
{{ list | join(', ') }}
```

To apply a filter on a section of code, wrap it with the `filter` tag:

```twig
{% filter lower | title %}
	hello<br>
{% endfilter %}}

```
