title: Flows
---

> Flows are used to implement your workload. They define all the tasks you want to perform and the order in which they will be run.

You define a flow thanks to a declarative model in YAML.

A flow must have an identifier (id), a namespace, and a list of [tasks](./02.tasks.md).

A flow can also have [inputs](./04.inputs.md), [listeners](./13.listeners.md), [error handlers](./07.errors-handling.md), and [triggers](./08.triggers/index.md).

## Flow sample

Here is a sample flow definition. It uses tasks available in Kestra core for testing purposes.

```yaml
id: samples
namespace: io.kestra.tests
description: "Some flow **documentation** in *Markdown*"

labels:
  env: prd
  country: FR

inputs:
  - name: my-value
    type: STRING
    required: false
    defaults: "default value"
    description: This is a not required my-value

variables:
  first: "1"
  second: "{{vars.first}} > 2"

tasks:
  - id: date
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    description: "Some tasks **documentation** in *Markdown*"
    format: "A log line content with a contextual date variable {{taskrun.startDate}}"

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    values:
      level: ERROR
```

### Labels

You can add arbitrary `labels` to your flows to sort them on multiple dimensions. When you execute such flow, the labels will be propagated to the created execution. It is also possible to override and define new labels at flow execution start.

### Task Defaults

You can also define `taskDefaults` inside your flow. This is a list of default task properties that will be applied to each task of a certain type inside your flow. Task defaults can be handy to avoid repeating the same value for a task property in case the same task type is used multiple times in the same flow.

### Variables 
You can set flow variables that will be accessible by each task using `{{ vars.key }}`. Flow `variables` is a map of key/value pairs.

### List of tasks 

The most important part of a flow is the list of tasks that will be run sequentially when the flow is executed.


## Flow Properties

The following flow properties can be set.

| Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`id`| The flow identifier, must be unique inside a namespace.                                                                                                                                      |
|`namespace`| Each flow lives in one namespace, this is useful for flow organization and is mandatory.                                                                                                     |
|`revision`| The flow version, handled internally by Kestra, and incremented for each modification. You should not manually set it.                                                                       |
|`description`| The description of the flow, more details [here](#document-your-flow).                                                                                                                       |
|`labels`| The list of labels which are string key/value pairs.                                                                                                                                         |
|`inputs`| The list of inputs, more details [here](./04.inputs.md).                                                                                                                                     |
|`variables`| The list of variables (such as api key, table name, URL, etc) that can be reached inside tasks with `{{ vars.name }}`.                                                                       |
|`tasks`| The list of tasks, all tasks will be run sequentially.                                                                                                                                       |
|`errors`| The list of error tasks, all listed tasks will be run sequentially only if there is an error on the current execution. More details [here](./07.errors-handling.md).                         |
|`listeners`| The list of listeners, more details [here](./13.listeners.md).                                                                                                                               |
|`triggers`| The list of triggers which are external events (such as date schedule or message presence in a broker, for example) that will launch this flow, more details [here](./08.triggers/index.md). |
|[`taskDefaults`](#taskdefaults)| The list of default task values, this avoid repeating the same properties on each tasks.                                                                                                     |
|`taskDefaults.[].type`| The task type is a full qualified Java class name.                                                                                                                                           |
|`taskDefaults.[].forced`| If set to `forced: true`, the taskDefault will take precedence over properties defined in the task (default `false`).                                                                        |
|`taskDefaults.[].values.xxx`| The task property that you want to be set as default.                                                                                                                                        |
|`disabled`| Set it to `true` to disable execution of the flow.                                                                                                                                           |


### `taskDefaults`

You can add task defaults to avoid repeating task properties on multiple occurrences of the same task in a `taskDefaults` properties. For example:

```yaml
id: python_test
namespace: test

tasks:

  - id: hello_from_docker
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.scripts.Python
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        print("Hello World!")

  - id: hello_from_docker_2
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.scripts.Python
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        print("Hello World again!")

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.core.tasks.scripts.Python
    values:
      virtualEnv: false
      commands:
        - python main.py
      runner: DOCKER
      dockerOptions:
        image: custom_python
        pullImage: false
```

Here, we avoid repeating Docker and Python configurations in each task by directly setting those within the `taskDefaults` property. This approach helps to streamline the configuration process and reduce the chances of errors caused by inconsistent settings across different tasks.

Note that when you move some required task attributes into the `taskDefaults` property, the code editor within the UI will complain that the required task argument is missing. The editor shows this message because `taskDefaults` are resolved at runtime and the editor is not aware of those default attributes until you run your flow. As long as `taskDefaults` contains the relevant arguments, you can save the flow and ignore the warning displayed in the editor.

## Document your flow

You can add documentation to flows, tasks, etc... to explain the goal of the current element.

For this, Kestra allows adding a `description` property where you can write documentation of the current element.
The description must be written using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

You can add a `description` property on:
- [Flows](./01.flow.md)
- [Tasks](./02.tasks.md)
- [Listeners](./13.listeners.md)
- [Triggers](./08.triggers/index.md)

All descriptions will be visible on the UI:
