Templates are lists of tasks that can be shared between flows. You can define a template and call it from other flows, allowing them to share a list of tasks and keep these tasks updated without changing your flow.

All tasks in a template will be executed sequentially; you can provide the same tasks that are found in a *standard* flow, including an *errors* branch.

Templates can have arguments passed via the `args` property.

## Example

Below is a flow sample that will include a template:

```yaml
id: with-template
namespace: io.kestra.tests

inputs:
  - name: store
    type: STRING
    required: true

tasks:
  - id: render-template
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Template
    namespace: io.kestra.tests
    templateId: template-example
    args:
      renamedStore: "{{ inputs.store }}"
```

If the template is defined like this:

```yaml
id: template-example
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: task-defined-by-template
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "{{ parent.outputs.args.renamedStore }}"
```

It will produce a flow similar to this one:

```yaml
id: with-template
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: render-template
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Sequential
    tasks:
      - id: task-defined-by-template
        type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
        format: "{{ inputs.store }}"
```

All the tasks within the template will be *copied* at runtime.

::alert{type="warning"}
From the template, you can access all the variables defined on the context executions. However, this is highly discouraged. The best will be to use the `args` property to rename variables from the global context to the template local one.
