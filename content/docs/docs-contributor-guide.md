## Overview

We love documentation contributions. To contribute to the documentation, make sure to fork the [docs repository](https://github.com/kestra-io/docs/fork) and create a pull request with your changes. We'll happily review and get your suggestions in the documentation set as quickly as we can.

For building the site locally check out the [Contributing Guide](./01.getting-started/03.contributing.md#contribute-to-the-documentation) to see the `npm` installation steps.

Aside from understanding the documentation's general structure and building the site locally, there are many custom implementations and markdown elements that we use across the documentation set to be familiar with. This page aims to cover all of the components you might come across when contributing to the Kestra Docs.
