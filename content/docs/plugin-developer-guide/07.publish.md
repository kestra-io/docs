Use the included Gradle task to build the plugin. Then, you can publish it to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com).

## Build a plugin
To build your plugin, execute the `./gradlew shadowJar` command from the plugin directory.

The resulting JAR file will be generated in the `build/libs` directory.

To use this plugin in your Kestra instance, add this JAR to the [Kestra plugins path](../server-cli/index.md#plugins-directory).

### Use a custom docker image with your plugin

Adding this `Dockerfile` to the root of your plugin project:
```
FROM kestra/kestra:develop

COPY build/libs/* /app/plugins/
```
You can build and run the image with the following command assuming you're in the root directory of your plugin:
`./gradlew shadowJar && docker build -t kestra-custom . && docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 kestra-custom server local`

You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080 and start using your custom plugin. Feel free to adapt the Dockerfile to your needs (eg. if you plan to use multiple custom plugins, include all builds directory in it).

## Publish a plugin

Here is how you can publish your plugin to Maven Central.

### GitHub Actions

The plugin template includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to test and publish your plugin. You can extend it by adding any additional testing or deployment steps.

### Publish to Maven Central
The template includes a Gradle task that will publish the plugin to Maven Central. You need a Maven Central account in order to publish your plugin.

You only need to configure the `gradle.properties` to have all required properties:

```yaml
sonatypeUsername=
sonatypePassword=
signing.keyId=
signing.password=
signing.secretKeyRingFile=

```


There is a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file that you can customize to your need:

::collapse{title="Example"}
```yaml
# Publish
- name: Publish package to Sonatype
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
  env:
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
  run: |
    echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
    ./gradlew publishToSonatype

# Release
- name: Release package to Maven Central
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
  env:
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
  run: |
    echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
    ./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
