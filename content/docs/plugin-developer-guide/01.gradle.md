We use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build tool. This page will help you configure Gradle for your plugin.

### Mandatory configuration
The first thing you need to configure is the plugin name and the class package.

1. Change in `settings.gradle` the `rootProject.name = 'plugin-template'` with your plugin name.
2. Change the class package: by default, the template provides a package `io.kestra.plugin.templates`, just rename the folder in `src/main/java` & `src/test/java`
3. Change the package name on `build.gradle`: replace `group "io.kestra.plugin.templates"` to the package name.


Now you can start [developing your task](./02.task.md) or look at other optional gradle configuration.

### Other configurations

#### Include some dependencies on plugins

You can add as many dependencies to your plugins, they will be isolated in the Kestra runtime. Thanks to this isolation, we ensure that two different versions of the same library will not clash and have runtime errors about missing methods.

The `build.gradle` handle most of Kestra use case by default using `compileOnly group: "io.kestra", name: "core", version: kestraVersion` for Kestra libs.

But if your plugin need some dependencies, you can add as many as you want that will be isolated, you just need to add `api` dependencies:

```groovy
api group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.8.6'
```
