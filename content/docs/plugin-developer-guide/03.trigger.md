Here is how you can develop a [Trigger](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/index.md).

::collapse{title="The Trigger example below will create an execution randomly"}

```java
@SuperBuilder
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Trigger extends AbstractTrigger implements PollingTriggerInterface, TriggerOutput<Trigger.Random> {
    @Builder.Default
    private final Duration interval = Duration.ofSeconds(60);

    protected Double min = 0.5;

    @Override
    public Optional<Execution> evaluate(ConditionContext conditionContext, TriggerContext context) {
        RunContext runContext = conditionContext.getRunContext();
        Logger logger = conditionContext.getRunContext().logger();
        double random = Math.random();

        if (random < this.min) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        Execution execution = Execution.builder()
            .id(runContext.getTriggerExecutionId())
            .namespace(context.getNamespace())
            .flowId(context.getFlowId())
            .flowRevision(context.getFlowRevision())
            .state(new State())
            .trigger(ExecutionTrigger.of(
                this,
                Trigger.Random.builder().random(random).build()
            ))
            .build();

        return Optional.of(execution);
    }

    @Builder
    @Getter
    public class Random implements io.kestra.core.models.tasks.Output {
        private Double random;
    }
}
```

You need to extend `PollingTriggerInterface` and implement the `Optional<Execution> evaluate(ConditionContext conditionContext, TriggerContext context)` method.

You can have any properties that you want, like for any task (validation, documentation, etc.), and everything works the same way.

The `evaluate` method will receive these arguments:
- `ConditionContext conditionContext`: a ConditionContext which includes various properties such as the RunContext in order to render your properties.
- `TriggerContext context`: to have the context of this call (flow, execution, trigger, date).

In this method, you can add any logic that you want: connect to a database, connect to remote file systems, ...
You don't have to take care of resources, Kestra will run this method in its own thread.

This method must return an `Optional<Execution>` with:
- `Optional.empty()`: if the condition is not validated.
- `Optional.of(execution)`: with the execution created if the condition is validated.

You have to provide an `Output` for any output needed (result of query, result of file system listing, etc.) that will be available for the flow tasks within the `{{ trigger.* }}` variables.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that the trigger must free the resource for the next evaluation. For each interval, this method will be called and if the conditions are met, an execution will be created.

To avoid this, move the file or remove the record from the database; take an action to avoid an infinite triggering.

### Realtime Triggers

Realtime Triggers are designed to start flow executions **immediately** in response to external, continuous events (such as messages in a queue, WebSockets, or continuous stream changes), rather than polling for changes periodically.

This architecture is ideal for event-driven flows where near real-time processing is required.

To create a Realtime Trigger, your plugin class must:

1.  **Implement the Interface:** Extend the `RealtimeTriggerInterface`. This interface requires the implementation of the `evaluate` method.

2.  **Overwrite the `evaluate` Method:** Implement the following method signature:

```java
// Method required by RealtimeTriggerInterface
Publisher<Execution> evaluate(ConditionContext conditionContext, TriggerContext triggerContext) throws Exception;
```

**Key Difference from Polling:**

Unlike Polling Triggers (which check if they should run and return an `Optional<Execution>`), the RealtimeTrigger returns a `Publisher<Execution>` (from Reactive Streams).

This allows the trigger to **maintain a connection or subscription** to the external system (e.g., a Kafka topic). It can then emit multiple `Execution` objects over time whenever a new event arrives, without re-evaluating the trigger at fixed intervals. This provides a more efficient and truly reactive way to handle streaming data.

**When to Use:**

Use the `RealtimeTriggerInterface` when your trigger needs to:

* Listen continuously to an external stream or event source.
* Remain active for the entire lifespan of the Kestra process.
* Emit new flow executions **only** when a new external event is received.

### Documentation

Remember to document your triggers. For this, we provide a set of annotations explained in the [Document each plugin](./06.document.md) section.
