Setup your environment for Plugin Development.

## Plugin Template
To get started with building a new plugin, make sure to use the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template), as it comes prepackaged with the standardized repository structure and deployment workflows.

That template will create a project hosting a group of plugins — we usually create multiple subplugins for a given service. For example, there's only one plugin for AWS, but it includes many subplugins for specific AWS services.

Note that the Kestra plugin library **version** must align with your Kestra instance. You may encounter validation issues during flow creation (e.g. `Invalid bean` response with status 422) when some plugins are on an older version of the Kestra plugin library. In that case, you may want to update the file `plugin-yourplugin/gradle.properties` and set the `version` property to the correct Kestra version e.g.:

```
version=0.17.0-SNAPSHOT
kestraVersion=[0.17,)
```

It's not mandatory that your plugin version matches the Kestra version, Kestra's official plugins version will always match the minor version of Kestra but it's only a best practice.

Then rebuild and publish the plugin.

### Requirements
Kestra plugins development requirements are:
* [Java](https://java.com) 21 or later.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (or any other Java IDE, we provide only help for IntelliJ IDEA).
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (included most of the time with the IDE).


### Create a new plugin

Here are the steps:

1. Go on the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template) repository.
2. Click on *Use this template*.
3. Choose the GitHub account you want to link and the repository name for the new plugin.
4. Clone the new repository: `git clone git@github.com:{{user}}/{{name}}.git`.
5. Open the cloned directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
6. Enable [annotations processors](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html).
7. If you are using an IntelliJ IDEA < 2020.03, install the [lombok plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok) (if not, it's included by default).


Once you completed the steps above, you should see a similar directory structure:

![Structure](/docs/plugin-developer-guide/plugins-architecture.png)

As you can see, there is one generated plugin: the `Example` class representing the `Example` plugin (a task).

A project typically hosts multiple plugins. We call a project a group of plugins, and you can have multiple sub-groups inside a project by splitting plugins into different packages. Each package that has a plugin class is a sub-group of plugins.

## Plugin icons

Plugin icons need to be added in the SVG format — see an example [here in the JIRA plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-jira/commit/64393190281c9001eb8f57b412a0d7d74f986d41).

**Where can you find icons?**
- for proprietary systems, Wikipedia is a good source of SVG icons
- for AWS services, the [AWS icons](https://awsicons.dev/) is a great resource
- [Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).
