Data teams use orchestration platforms like Kestra to manage complex pipelines — ingest raw data, transform it, and deliver it to data warehouses, lakes, and user-facing applications. The orchestration engine ensures workflows run in the correct sequence, recover from failures, and scale dynamically.

## What is Data Orchestration?

Data orchestration automates the execution of interconnected tasks (ETL, Analytics, AI and ML jobs) while governing their dependencies and business logic. It focuses on **how data moves** between systems, teams and processes.

Kestra's data orchestration capabilities include:
- **Flexible workflow triggers** — run data flows on schedule, external events (e.g., a new file in S3/SFTP), or API calls.
- **Powerful orchestration engine** — control retries, parallel task runs, timeouts, SLAs, concurrency and error handling.
- **Dynamic resource allocation** — provision containers on-demand (e.g., AWS Fargate, GCP Batch, Azure Batch, Kubernetes) for compute-heavy tasks.
- **Visibility** — track logs, traces, metrics, inputs, outputs, and lineage across workflows and tasks.

## Why Use Kestra for Data Orchestration?

1. **Simple Declarative Syntax** – Define each data pipeline in a self-contained, portable YAML configuration that includes tasks, triggers, dependencies and infrastructure requirements.
2. **Extensible Integrations** – Connect to over 600 services via [pre-built plugins](https://kestra.io/plugins). Thanks to plugins, you can avoid writing custom code for boilerplate tasks like file downloads, SQL queries, or REST API calls.
3. **Execution Control** – Set retries, timeouts, SLAs, and concurrency limits.
4. **Zero Code Changes** – Run existing Python/R/SQL scripts as-is (no rewrites needed); specify dependencies via YAML configuration.
5. **State Management** – Pass data of any size between tasks (_files, variables, query results_) or between workflows (_using KV Store_) thanks to [internal storage](../08.architecture/data-components.md#internal-storage).
6. **Dynamic Scaling** – Scale custom code with [task runners](../task-runners/index.md). Spin up containers on cloud services (AWS ECS Fargate, Google Batch, Kubernetes) dynamically at runtime — no need for dedicated always-on workers (_to scale on-premise deployments, you can use [worker groups](../07.enterprise/04.scalability/worker-group.md)_).
7. **Observability** – Monitor flow execution states, durations, logs, inputs, outputs and resource usage in real time.

## Example: Data Engineering Pipeline

The following flow triggers a data sync from Airbyte, Fivetran, and dbt Cloud. Then, it downloads a JSON dataset via REST API, filters specific columns using Python, and calculates KPIs with DuckDB. Kestra dynamically provisions a Python container for the task running custom code and terminates it once the task completes:

```yaml
id: data_pipeline
namespace: tutorial
description: Process product data to calculate brand price averages

inputs:
  - id: columns_to_keep
    type: ARRAY
    itemType: STRING
    defaults:
      - brand
      - price

tasks:
  - id: airbyte_sync
    type: io.kestra.plugin.airbyte.connections.Sync
    url: http://localhost:8080
    connectionId: e3b1ce92-547c-436f-b1e8-23b6936c12cd
    wait: true

  - id: fivetran_sync
    type: io.kestra.plugin.fivetran.connectors.Sync
    apiKey: "{{ secret('FIVETRAN_API_KEY') }}"
    apiSecret: "{{ secret('FIVETRAN_API_SECRET') }}"
    connectorId: myConnectorId
    wait: true

  - id: dbt_job
    type: io.kestra.plugin.dbt.cloud.TriggerRun
    accountId: dbt_account
    token: "{{ secret('DBT_CLOUD_TOKEN') }}"
    jobId: abc12345
    wait: true

  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://dummyjson.com/products

  # Filter columns in a disposable Python container
  - id: transform
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    containerImage: python:3.11-slim
    taskRunner: # spins up container on-demand
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
    inputFiles:
      data.json: "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"  # Input from previous task
    outputFiles:
      - "*.json"
    script: |
      import json
      filtered_data = [
          {col: product.get(col, "N/A") for col in {{ inputs.columns_to_keep }}}
          for product in json.load(open("data.json"))["products"]
      ]
      json.dump(filtered_data, open("products.json", "w"), indent=4)

  # Analyze filtered data with DuckDB
  - id: query
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    fetchType: STORE
    inputFiles:
      products.json: "{{ outputs.transform.outputFiles['products.json'] }}"
    sql: |
      INSTALL json;
      LOAD json;
      SELECT brand, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
      FROM read_json_auto('{{ workingDir }}/products.json')
      GROUP BY brand
      ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

## Getting Started with Data Orchestration

1. **Install Kestra** – Follow the [quick start guide](../01.quickstart/index.md) or the full [installation instructions for production environments](../02.installation/index.md).
2. **Write Your Workflows** – Configure your [flow](../03.tutorial/index.md) in YAML, declaring inputs, tasks, and triggers. Tasks can be anything — scripts, queries, remote jobs or API calls. Add `retry`, `timeout`, `concurrency` or `taskRunner` settings to scale tasks dynamically and manage data orchestration logic.
3. **Add Triggers** – Execute flows manually, via schedules, API, flow or event [triggers](../05.workflow-components/07.triggers/index.md) (e.g., S3 file uploads).
4. **Observe and Manage** – Use [Kestra’s UI](../09.ui/index.md) to inspect workflow outputs, logs, execution states, and dependencies.
