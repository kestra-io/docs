title: Automate Manual Approval Processes
description: Integrate Human-in-the-Loop approvals into critical steps of automated workflows
---

Modern automation requires human oversight for critical decisions. Kestra enables integration of manual approval steps within workflows while maintaining audit trails and process consistency.

## What is Human-in-the-Loop Automation?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) automation combines automated tasks with human decision points. Kestra implements this through:
- **Pause/Resume** – Pause workflows for manual inspection before resuming
- **Dynamic Inputs** – Collect user decisions during execution
- **Approval Chains** – Route decisions to specific users or teams
- **Audit Logs** – Track who approved/rejected each request and why.

---

## Why Use Kestra for Human-in-the-Loop Workflows?

1. **Flexible Integration** – Add approval steps to existing workflows in a few lines of YAML
2. **Enterprise Security** – Manage permissions via namespace-level RBAC
3. **Cross-Platform Notifications** – Send approval requests to Slack, Teams, or Email
4. **Input Validation** – Enforce structured responses (Numeric, Boolean, Dates, Dropdowns)
5. **Bulk Actions** – Bulk-resume multiple paused workflows when needed.
6. **Audit Trails** – Track approvals, rejections, and reasons for each decision.

## Example: Vacation Approval Workflow

This workflow demonstrates a complete approval process with Slack notifications and audit logging:

```yaml
id: vacation_approval
namespace: hr.operations

inputs:
  - id: employee
    type: STRING
  - id: start_date
    type: DATE
  - id: end_date
    type: DATE

tasks:
  - id: notify_manager
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_HR_WEBHOOK') }}"
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#vacation-approvals",
        "text": "Review request from {{ inputs.employee }}\n*Dates*: {{ inputs.start_date }} → {{ inputs.end_date }}\nApprove: {{ appLink('appId') }}"
      }

  - id: await_decision
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: approved
        type: BOOLEAN
        description: Approve this request?
      - id: reason
        type: STRING
        description: Decision notes

  - id: update_hr_system
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: "{{ kv('HR_API_ENDPOINT') }}/approvals"
    method: POST
    contentType: multipart/form-data
    formData:
      employee: "{{ inputs.employee }}"
      status: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.approved ? 'APPROVED' : 'REJECTED' }}"
      notes: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.reason }}"

  - id: log_result
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: |
      Decision: {{ outputs.await_decision.onResume }}
```

##  Kestra Features for Human-in-the-Loop Automation

### Structured Inputs for Human Decisions

Add approval steps with structured inputs to any workflow:
```yaml
  - id: await_decision
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: approved
        type: BOOLEAN
        displayName: Approve this request?
      - id: reason
        type: STRING
        displayName: Decision notes
      - id: team
        type: SELECT
        displayName: Team to review
        values:
          - HR
          - Finance
          - IT
```

### Bulk Actions

Approve multiple paused workflows simultaneously:
![Bulk Resume](/docs/how-to-guides/pause-resume/pause_resume2.png)

### Audit Trails

Audit Logs capture who approved or rejected each request, and the Pause task's outputs contain the user's decision:
```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "reason": "Within policy limits"
}
```

### Conditional Branching

Route next automated tasks based on human decisions:
```yaml
  - id: handle_rejection
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
    condition: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.approved is false }}"
    then:
      - id: notify_employee
        type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.mail.MailSend
        to: "{{ inputs.employee_email }}"
        subject: "Request Denied"
        htmlTextContent: "Reason: {{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.reason }}"
```

## Getting Started with Human-in-the-Loop Automation

1. **Install Kestra** – Follow the [quick start guide](../01.getting-started/01.quickstart.md) or the full [installation instructions for production environments](../02.installation/index.md).
2. **Write Your Workflows** – Configure your [flow](../03.tutorial/index.md) in YAML. Each automated task can invoke an API, run scripts, or call any existing service. Then, add `Pause` tasks for manual approvals:
   ```yaml
   - id: approval_gate
     type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
     onResume:
       - id: signoff
         type: BOOLEAN
         required: true
   ```
3. **Configure Notifications** – Use Slack, Teams, or Email plugins to notify users about pending approvals:
   ```yaml
   - id: alert
     type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.teams.TeamsIncomingWebhook
     url: "{{ secret('TEAMS_WEBHOOK') }}"
     payload: |
       {
         "text": "The process {{ flow.id }} is pending approval {{ appLink() }}"
       }
   ```
4. **Add Triggers** – Use scheduled or event-based [triggers](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/index.md) to launch workflows.
5. **Observe and Manage** – Use [Kestra’s UI](../08.ui/index.md) to monitor states, logs, outputs, and metrics. Correct and replay failed workflow executions or roll back to a previous revision when needed.
