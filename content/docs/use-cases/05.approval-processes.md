---

Modern automation requires human oversight for critical decisions. Kestra enables integration of manual approval steps within workflows while maintaining audit trails and process consistency.

## What is Human-in-the-Loop Automation?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) automation combines automated tasks with human decision points. Kestra implements this through:
- **Pause/Resume** – Pause workflows for manual inspection before resuming
- **Dynamic Inputs** – Collect user decisions during execution
- **Approval Chains** – Route decisions to specific users or teams
- **Audit Logs** – Track who approved/rejected each request and why.

---

## Why Use Kestra for Human-in-the-Loop Workflows?

1. **Flexible Integration** – Add approval steps to existing workflows in a few lines of YAML
2. **Enterprise Security** – Manage permissions via namespace-level RBAC
3. **Cross-Platform Notifications** – Send approval requests to Slack, Teams, or Email
4. **Input Validation** – Enforce structured responses (Numeric, Boolean, Dates, Dropdowns)
5. **Bulk Actions** – Bulk-resume multiple paused workflows when needed.
6. **Audit Trails** – Track approvals, rejections, and reasons for each decision.

## Example: Vacation Approval Workflow

This workflow demonstrates a complete approval process with Slack notifications and audit logging:

```yaml
id: vacation_approval
namespace: hr.operations

inputs:
  - id: employee
    type: STRING
    required: false
  - id: start_date
    type: DATE
  - id: end_date
    type: DATE

tasks:
  - id: notify_manager
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_HR_WEBHOOK') }}"
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#vacation-approvals",
        "text": "Review request from {{ inputs.employee ?? labels.system.username }}\n*Dates*: {{ inputs.start_date }} → {{ inputs.end_date }}\nApprove: {{ appLink('appId') }}"
      }

  - id: await_decision
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: approved
        type: BOOLEAN
        description: Approve this request?
      - id: reason
        type: STRING
        description: Decision notes

  - id: update_hr_system
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: "{{ kv('HR_API_ENDPOINT') }}/approvals"
    method: POST
    contentType: multipart/form-data
    formData:
      employee: "{{ inputs.employee ?? labels.system.username }}"
      approvalStatus: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.approved ? 'APPROVED' : 'REJECTED' }}"
      notes: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.reason }}"
      resumedBy: "{{ outputs.await_decision.resumed.by }}"
      resumedOn: "{{ outputs.await_decision.resumed.on }}"
      resumedStatus: "{{ outputs.await_decision.resumed.to }}" # by default: SUCCESS

  - id: log_result
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: |
      Decision: {{ outputs.await_decision.onResume }}
```

##  Kestra Features for Human-in-the-Loop Automation

### Structured Inputs for Human Decisions

Add approval steps with structured inputs to any workflow:
```yaml
  - id: await_decision
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: approved
        type: BOOLEAN
        displayName: Approve this request?
      - id: reason
        type: STRING
        displayName: Decision notes
      - id: team
        type: SELECT
        displayName: Team to review
        values:
          - HR
          - Finance
          - IT
```

### Bulk Actions

Approve multiple paused workflows simultaneously:
![Bulk Resume](/docs/how-to-guides/pause-resume/pause_resume2.png)

### Audit Trails

Audit Logs capture who approved or rejected each request, and the Pause task's outputs contain the user's decision:
```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "reason": "Within policy limits"
}
```

### Conditional Branching

Route next automated tasks based on human decisions:
```yaml
  - id: handle_rejection
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
    condition: "{{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.approved is false }}"
    then:
      - id: notify_employee
        type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.mail.MailSend
        to: "{{ inputs.employee_email }}"
        subject: "Request Denied"
        htmlTextContent: "Reason: {{ outputs.await_decision.onResume.reason }}"
```

## HumanTask: Assign Specific Users for Approval

:::badge{version=">=1.1" editions="EE"}
:::

For enterprise use cases where specific users or groups must handle approvals, use the `HumanTask` instead of the basic `Pause` task. This ensures only authorized users can resume paused executions.

### Key Benefits of HumanTask

- **User-Specific Assignments** – Assign approval tasks to specific users by email
- **Group-Based Permissions** – Route approvals to entire RBAC groups
- **Access Control** – Prevent unauthorized users from resuming executions
- **Auditability** – Track who approved what for audit and compliance.

When an unauthorized user attempts to resume a `HumanTask`, they receive an "Access denied to resume this execution" error.

### Basic HumanTask Example

```yaml
id: vm_provisioning_approval
namespace: infrastructure

inputs:
  - id: vm_spec
    type: STRING
    defaults: "2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04"

tasks:
  - id: validate_request
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Validating VM request from {{ labels.system.username }}: {{ inputs.vm_spec }}"

  - id: it_admin_approval
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.flow.HumanTask
    assignment:
      users:
        - it-admin@company.com
        - infrastructure-lead@company.com

  - id: provision_vm
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Approved by {{ outputs.it_admin_approval.resumed.by }}! Provisioning VM for {{ labels.system.username }}"
```

### Group-Based Assignment

You can assign approvals to entire RBAC groups for team-based Human-in-the-loop workflows:

```yaml
  - id: security_review
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.flow.HumanTask
    assignment:
      groups:
        - Security Team
        - DevOps Engineers
        - Infrastructure Admins
```

### Combined User and Group Assignment

When needed, you can also mix `users` and `groups` to allow both individual users and users from specific RBAC groups to approve the workflow:

```yaml
  - id: production_deployment_approval
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.flow.HumanTask
    assignment:
      users:
        - platform-lead@company.com
        - release-manager@company.com
      groups:
        - DevOps Team
        - Site Reliability Engineers
```

## Best practices for long-running workflows

Long approvals can take days or weeks. Kestra persists execution state (including `PAUSED` state) in the database, so a paused execution survives server restarts and stays `PAUSED` until you manually resume it via the UI or API.

### Keep downstream logic in the same flow (simplest and most common pattern)

The simplest pattern is to keep the entire downstream logic in the same flow after the Pause task:

```yaml
id: pause_demo
namespace: demo

tasks:
  - id: initial_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: placeholder for tasks with initial logic before the pause

  - id: wait_for_manual_resume
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: status
        type: STRING

  - id: entire_downstream_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: can have multiple tasks defined here after the pause task
```

Use this when it’s easier to continue in the same execution after the Pause; for larger systems, consider calling a subflow containing the downstream logic for modularity:

```yaml
id: pause_demo_with_subflow
namespace: demo

tasks:
  - id: initial_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: placeholder for tasks with initial logic before the pause

  - id: wait_for_manual_resume
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: status
        type: STRING

  - id: entire_downstream_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow
    namespace: demo
    flowId: downstream_logic_flow
```

### Pause + Manual resume + Flow trigger pattern

1) Flow that can stay paused as long as needed:

```yaml
id: pause_demo
namespace: demo

tasks:
  - id: initial_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: placeholder for tasks with initial logic before the pause

  - id: wait_for_manual_resume
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: status
        type: STRING
```

2) Resume the paused execution via API when ready:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:28080/api/v1/demo/executions/23F2KgSYm3uCfHJ00DvNxY/resume" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -F 'status=OK' -H "Authorization: Bearer your_service_account_api_token"
```

3) React to the resumed flow’s completion using a Flow trigger (fires on SUCCESS of `pause_demo`):

```yaml
id: resume_demo
namespace: demo

tasks:
  - id: entire_downstream_logic
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: can have multiple tasks defined here that should run after the first flow completes

triggers:
  - id: flow
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    preconditions:
      id: flow1
      flows:
        - flowId: pause_demo
          namespace: demo
          states:
            - SUCCESS
```

Why this is robust:
- The `Pause` task can keep the execution in `PAUSED` for weeks; the state is persisted in the DB and survives server restarts.
- You resume explicitly from the UI or via API when a decision is made.
- Downstream automation is cleanly decoupled and reacts only after the first flow completes successfully.

:::alert{type="info"}
Note that the Flow trigger cannot react to a `RESUMED` state as this state is not observable. While you could react to the `RESTARTED` state, this state is used not only for resumed executions after paused but also for executions restarted after a failure, which may not be what you want. Therefore, we recommend that you design your Flow trigger to react directly to the `SUCCESS` state as shown above.

### Understanding `behavior` vs. Resume/Kill from UI or API

The `behavior` property on a `Pause` task applies **only when the pause duration (`pauseDuration`) elapses**. It determines whether the workflow should automatically `CANCEL` or `RESUME` once the timer expires.

When you **manually resume or kill** a paused execution through the **UI** or **API**, Kestra does **not** apply the `behavior` property:
* When you **resume**, the paused task ends, and the workflow continues to the next task in sequence.
* When you **kill**, the entire execution transitions to the `KILLING` state, and all running or paused taskruns are stopped accordingly.

Example:

```yaml
  - id: wait_five_minutes
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    behavior: CANCEL
    pauseDuration: PT5M
```

* If the `pauseDuration` elapses, the task run ends in a `CANCELED` state, and the execution stops.
* If you **resume** manually before that time, the execution continues, ignoring the `behavior` property.
* If you **kill** manually before that time, the execution moves to the `KILLING` state, ensuring all tasks are stopped.

Since Kestra 0.24, there’s [no longer](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/12547) the need to add an explicit `Kill` task after the `Pause` task to stop the execution.

## Getting Started with Human-in-the-Loop Automation

1. **Install Kestra** – Follow the [quick start guide](../01.quickstart/index.md) or the full [installation instructions for production environments](../02.installation/index.md).
2. **Write Your Workflows** – Configure your [flow](../03.tutorial/index.md) in YAML. Each automated task can invoke an API, run scripts, or call any existing service. Then, add `Pause` tasks for manual approvals:
   ```yaml
   - id: approval_gate
     type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
     onResume:
       - id: signoff
         type: BOOLEAN
         required: true
   ```
3. **Configure Notifications** – Use Slack, Teams, or Email plugins to notify users about pending approvals:
   ```yaml
   - id: alert
     type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.teams.TeamsIncomingWebhook
     url: "{{ secret('TEAMS_WEBHOOK') }}"
     payload: |
       {
         "text": "The process {{ flow.id }} is pending approval {{ appLink() }}"
       }
   ```
4. **Add Triggers** – Use scheduled or event-based [triggers](../05.workflow-components/07.triggers/index.md) to launch workflows.
5. **Observe and Manage** – Use [Kestra’s UI](../09.ui/index.md) to monitor states, logs, outputs, and metrics. Correct and replay failed workflow executions or roll back to a previous revision when needed.
