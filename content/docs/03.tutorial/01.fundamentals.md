## Flows

[Flows](../04.workflow-components/01.flow.md) are defined in a declarative YAML syntax to keep the orchestration code portable and language-agnostic.

Each flow consists of three **required** components: `id`, `namespace`, and `tasks`:
1. `id` represents the name of the flow.
2. `namespace` can be used to separate development and production environments.
3. `tasks` is a list of tasks that will be executed in the order they are defined.

Here are those three components in a YAML file:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello_world
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World!
```

The `id` of a flow must be **unique within a namespace**. For example:
- ✅ you can have a flow named `getting_started` in the `company.team1` namespace and another flow named `getting_started` in the `company.team2` namespace.
- ❌ you cannot have two flows named `getting_started` in the `company.team` namespace at the same time.

The combination of `id` and `namespace` serves as a **unique identifier** for a flow.

### Namespaces

[Namespaces](../04.workflow-components/02.namespace.md) are used to group flows and provide structure. Keep in mind that the allocation of a flow to a namespace is immutable. Once a flow is created, you cannot change its namespace. If you need to change the namespace of a flow, create a new flow within the desired namespace and delete the old flow.


### Labels

To add another layer of organization, you can use [labels](../04.workflow-components/08.labels.md), allowing you to group flows using key-value pairs. In short, labels are customizable tags to simplify monitoring and filtering of flows and executions.


### Description(s)

You can optionally add a [description](../04.workflow-components/15.descriptions.md) property to document your flow's purpose or other useful information. The `description` is a string that supports **markdown** syntax. That markdown description will be rendered and displayed in the UI.

::alert{type="info"}
Not only flows can have a description. You can also add a `description` property to `tasks` and `triggers` to document all the components of your workflow.

Here is the same flow as before, but this time with **labels** and **descriptions**:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

description: |
  # Getting Started
  Let's `write` some **markdown** - [first flow](https://t.ly/Vemr0) 🚀

labels:
  owner: rick.astley
  project: never-gonna-give-you-up

tasks:
  - id: hello_world
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World!
    description: |
      ## About this task
      This task will print "Hello World!" to the logs.
```

## Tasks

[Tasks](../04.workflow-components/01.tasks/index.md) are atomic actions in your flows. You can design your tasks to be small and granular, such as fetching data from a REST API or running a self-contained Python script. However, tasks can also represent large and complex processes, like triggering containerized processes or long-running batch jobs (e.g., using dbt, Spark, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, etc.) and waiting for their completion.

### The order of task execution

Tasks are defined in the form of a **list**. By default, all tasks in the list will be executed **sequentially** — the second task will start as soon as the first one finishes successfully.

Kestra provides additional **customization** to run tasks **in parallel**, iterating (_sequentially or in parallel_) over a list of items, or to **allow failure** of specific tasks. These kinds of actions are called [`Flowable`](./05.flowable.md) tasks because they define the flow logic.

A task in Kestra must have an `id` and a `type`. Other properties depend on the task type. You can think of a task as a step in a flow that should execute a specific action, such as running a Python or Node.js script in a Docker container or loading data from a database.

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: python
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    containerImage: python:slim
    script: |
      print("Hello World!")
```

### Autocompletion

Kestra supports [hundreds of tasks](/plugins) integrating with various external systems. Use the shortcut `CTRL + SPACE` on Windows/Linux or `fn + control + SPACE` on MacOS to trigger **autocompletion** to list available tasks or properties of a given task.

::alert{type="info"}
If you want to **comment out** some part of your code, use the `CTRL + K + C` on Windows/Linux or `⌘ + fn + K + C` on MacOS shortcut, and to uncomment it, use `CTRL + K + U` on Windows/Linux or `⌘ + fn + K + U` on MacOS. To remember the shortcuts, `C` stands for `comment` and `U` stands for `uncomment`. All available keyboard shortcuts are listed upon right-clicking anywhere in the code editor.

## Supported task types

Let's look at supported task types.

### Core

**Core tasks** from the `io.kestra.plugin.core.flow` category are commonly used to control the flow logic. You can use them to declare which processes should run **in parallel** or **sequentially**. You can specify **conditional branching**, **iterating** over a list of items, **pausing** or allowing certain tasks to fail without failing the execution.

### Scripts

**Script tasks** are used to run scripts in Docker containers or local processes. You can use them to run Python, Node.js, R, Julia, or any other script. You can also use them to execute a series of commands in Shell or PowerShell. Check the [Script tasks](../16.scripts/index.md) page for more details.

### Internal storage

Tasks from the `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage` category, along with [Outputs](../04.workflow-components/06.outputs.md), are used to interact with the **internal storage**. Kestra uses internal storage to **pass data between tasks**. You can think of internal storage as an S3 bucket. In fact, you can use your private S3 bucket as internal storage. 

This storage layer helps prevent connector proliferation. For example, the PostgreSQL plugin can extract data from a PostgreSQL database and load it into internal storage. Other tasks can then access this data and load it into systems like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift—or process it with any other plugin—without requiring direct point-to-point connections.

### KV Store

Internal storage is mainly used to pass data within a single flow execution. If you need to pass data between different flow executions, you can use the **[KV Store](../05.concepts/05.kv-store.md)**. The tasks `Set`, `Get`, and `Delete` from the `io.kestra.plugin.core.kv` category allow you to persist data between executions (even across namespaces). For example, if you are using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), you can leverage the KV Store to persist the `manifest.json` file between executions and implement the slim CI pattern.

### ⚡️ Plugins

Apart from **core tasks**, the [plugins library](/plugins) provides a wide range of integrations. Kestra has built-in plugins for data ingestion, data transformation, interacting with databases, object stores, or message queues, and the list keeps growing with every new release. On top of that, you can also [create your own plugins](../plugin-developer-guide/index.md) to integrate with any system or programming language.

## Create and run your first flow

Now, let's create and run your first flow. On the left side of the screen, click on the **Flows** menu. Then, click on the **Create** button.

![Create flow](/docs/tutorial/fundamentals/create_button.png)

Paste the following code to the Flow editor:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: https://dummyjson.com/products
```

Then, hit the **Save** button.

![Create flow](/docs/tutorial/fundamentals/save_button.png)

This flow has a single task that will fetch data from the [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/) API. Let's run it!

![New execution](/docs/tutorial/fundamentals/new_execution.png)

After executing, you'll be directed to the Gantt view to see the stages of your flow progress. In this simple example, we see the API request successfully execute. We'll continue adding more to our flow in the coming sections.
