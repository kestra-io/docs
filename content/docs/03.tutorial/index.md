You can use Kestra to:
- Run workflows on demand, event-driven, or on a schedule.
- Interact with any system or language through plugins and tasks.
- Orchestrate microservices, batch jobs, scripts, SQL queries, data syncs, dbt or Spark jobs, and other processes.

This tutorial starts with a simple flow that makes an API request and then expands to use nearly Kestra's full toolbox: adding Inputs, downstream tasks, scripts, Outputs, and Triggers. Later sections cover conditional flow logic, parallel task execution, and error handling.
