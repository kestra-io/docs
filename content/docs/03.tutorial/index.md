You can use Kestra to:
- run workflows on demand, event-driven, or on a schedule
- interact with any system or language through plugins and tasks
- orchestrate microservices, batch jobs, scripts, SQL queries, data syncs, dbt or Spark jobs, and other processes

This tutorial starts from the “Hello world” flow in the [Quickstart Guide](../01.quickstart/index.md), then adds namespaces, tasks, inputs, and triggers. Later sections cover parallel task execution, error handling, and running scripts or services in isolated containers.
