Handle errors with automatic retries and notifications.

Failure is inevitable. Kestra provides automatic retries and error handling to help you build resilient workflows.

## Error handling

By default, a failure of any task will stop the execution and will mark it as failed.
For more control over error handling, you can add `errors` tasks, `AllowFailure` tasks, or automatic retries.

The `errors` property allows you to execute one or more actions before terminating the flow, e.g. sending an email or a Slack message to your team. The property is named `errors` because they are triggered upon errors within your flow.

You can implement error handling at the flow-level or on a namespace-level.
1. **Flow-level**: Useful to implement custom alerting for a specific flow or task. This can be accomplished by adding `errors` tasks.
2. **Namespace-level**: Useful to send a notification for any failed Execution within a given namespace. This approach allows you to implement centralized error handling for all flows within a given namespace.

## Flow-level error handling using `errors`

The `errors` is a property of a flow that accepts a list of tasks that will be executed when an error occurs. You can add as many tasks as you want, and they will be executed sequentially.

The example below sends a flow-level failure alert via Slack using the [SlackIncomingWebhook](/plugins/plugin-notifications/slack/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.slackincomingwebhook) task defined using the `errors` property.


```yaml
id: unreliable_flow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

errors:
  - id: alert_on_failure
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK') }}" # https://hooks.slack.com/services/xyz/xyz/xyz
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Failure alert for flow {{ flow.namespace }}.{{ flow.id }} with ID {{ execution.id }}"
      }
```

Check the [error handling](../04.workflow-components/11.errors.md) page for more details.

## Namespace-level error handling using a Flow trigger

To get notified on a workflow failure, you can leverage Kestra's built-in notification tasks, including among others (_the list keeps growing with new releases_):
- [Slack](/plugins/plugin-notifications/slack/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.slackexecution)
- [Microsoft Teams](/plugins/plugin-notifications/teams/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.teams.teamsexecution)
- [Email](/plugins/plugin-notifications/mail/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.mail.mailexecution)


For a centralized namespace-level alerting, we recommend adding a dedicated monitoring workflow with one of the above mentioned notification tasks and a Flow trigger. Below is an example workflow that automatically sends a Slack alert as soon as any flow in the namespace `company.team` fails or finishes with warnings.

```yaml
id: failure_alert
namespace: system

tasks:
  - id: send
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackExecution
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK') }}"
    channel: "#general"
    executionId: "{{trigger.executionId}}"

triggers:
  - id: listen
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExecutionStatus
        in:
          - FAILED
          - WARNING
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExecutionNamespace
        namespace: company.team
        prefix: true
```

Adding this single flow will ensure that you receive a Slack alert on any flow failure in the `company.team` namespace. Here is an example alert notification:

## Retries

When working with external systems, transient errors are common. For example, a file may not be available yet, an API might be temporarily unreachable, or a database can be under maintenance. In such cases, retries can automatically fix the issue without human intervention.


### Configuring retries

Each task can be retried a certain number of times and in a specific way. Use the `retry` property with the desired type of retry.

The following types of retries are currently supported:
- **Constant**: The task will be retried every X seconds/minutes/hours/days.
- **Exponential**: The task will also be retried every X seconds/minutes/hours/days but with an exponential backoff (i.e., an exponential time interval in between each retry attempt.)
- **Random**: The task will be retried every X seconds/minutes/hours/days with a random delay (i.e., a random time interval in between each retry attempt.)

In this example, we will retry the task 5 times up to 1 minute of a total task run duration, with a constant interval of 2 seconds between each retry attempt.

```yaml
id: retries
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: fail_four_times
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - 'if [ "{{ taskrun.attemptsCount }}" -eq 4 ]; then exit 0; else exit 1; fi'
    retry:
      type: constant
      interval: PT2S
      maxAttempt: 5
      maxDuration: PT1M
      warningOnRetry: false

errors:
  - id: will_never_run
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: This will never be executed as retries will fix the issue
```



### Adding a retry configuration to our tutorial workflow

Let's get back to our example from the [Fundamentals](./01.fundamentals.md) section. We will add a retry configuration to the `api` task. API calls are prone to transient errors, so we will retry that task up to 10 times, for at most 1 hour of total duration, every 10 seconds (i.e., with a constant interval of 10 seconds in between retry attempts).

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: https://dummyjson.com/products
    retry:
      type: constant
      interval: PT20S
      maxDuration: PT1H
      maxAttempt: 10
      warningOnRetry: true
```
