## Tasks running in Docker containers

Many tasks in Kestra will run in dedicated Docker containers, including among others:
- [Script tasks](/docs/developer-guide/scripts) running Python, Node.js, R, Julia, Bash, and more
- [Singer tasks](/plugins/plugin-singer) running data ingestion syncs
- [dbt tasks](/plugins/plugin-dbt) running dbt jobs

Kestra uses Docker for those tasks to ensure that they run in a consistent environment and to avoid dependency conflicts.


::alert{type="warning"}
Those tasks require a Docker daemon running on the host. Refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](../faq/01.troubleshooting.md) if you encounter any issues configuring Docker.

## Defining a Docker runner

To run a task in a Docker container, set the `runner` property to `DOCKER`:

```yaml
runner: DOCKER
```

Many tasks, including [Python](/plugins/plugin-script-python/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.script), use the `DOCKER` runner by default.

Using the `docker` property, you can define the Docker image for the task. You can use any image from a public or private container registry, as well as a custom local image built from a Dockerfile. You may even build a Docker image using the [Docker plugin](/plugins/plugin-docker) in one task, and reference the built image by the tag in a downstream task.

```yaml
docker:
  image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
```

The `docker` property also allows you to configure `credentials` with nested `username` and `password` properties to authenticate a private container registry.

```yaml
id: private_docker_image
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: custom_image
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: ghcr.io/your_org/your_package:tag
      credentials:
        username: your_username
        password: "{{ secret('GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN') }}"
    script: |
        print("this runs using a private container image")
```

The task documentation of each script task provides more details about available `docker` properties.

For more examples of running scripts in Docker containers, check the [Script tasks](/docs/developer-guide/scripts) page.
