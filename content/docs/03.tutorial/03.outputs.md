Outputs allow you to pass data between tasks and flows.

Tasks and flows can generate outputs, which can be passed to downstream processes. These outputs can be variables or files stored in the [internal storage](/docs/architecture/internal-storage).

## How to retrieve outputs

Use the syntax `{{ outputs.task_id.output_property }}` to retrieve a specific output of a task.

If your task id contains one or more hyphens (i.e. the `-` sign), wrap the task id in square brackets, e.g. `{{ outputs['task-id'].output_property }}`.

To see which outputs have been generated during a flow execution, go to the **Outputs** tab on the Execution page:
![Output of our previous download](/docs/tutorial/outputs/output.png)

The outputs are useful for troubleshooting and auditing. Additionally, you can use outputs to:
- share **downloadable artifacts** with business stakeholders, e.g. a table generated by a SQL query, or a CSV file generated by a Python script
- **pass data** between decoupled processes (e.g. pass subflow's outputs or a file detected by S3 trigger to downstream tasks)

## Use outputs in your flow

When fetching data from a REST API, Kestra stores that fetched data in the internal storage, and makes it available to downstream tasks using the `body` output argument.

Use the `{{ outputs.task_id.body }}` syntax to process that fetched data in a downstream task, as shown in the Python script task below.

```yaml
id: getting_started_output
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: api_url
    type: STRING
    defaults: https://dummyjson.com/products

tasks:
  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: "{{ inputs.api_url }}"

  - id: python
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: python:slim
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install polars
    warningOnStdErr: false
    outputFiles:
      - "products.csv"
    script: |
      import polars as pl
      data = {{outputs.api.body | jq('.products') | first}}
      df = pl.from_dicts(data)
      df.glimpse()
      df.select(["brand", "price"]).write_csv("products.csv")
```

This flow processes data using Polars and stores the result as a CSV file.

::alert{type="info"}
To avoid package dependency conflicts, the Python task is running in an **independent Docker container**. You can optionally provide a **custom Docker image** from a private container registry, or use a public Python image from DockerHub, and install any custom package dependencies using the `beforeCommands` argument. The `beforeCommands` argument allows you to install any custom package dependencies — here, we install [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/). Use as many commands as needed to prepare containerized environment for the script execution.

## Debug Outputs

When referencing the output from the previous task, this flow uses `jq` [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jq_(programming_language)) to extract the `products` array from the API response — `jq` is available in all Kestra tasks without having to install it.

You can test `{{ outputs.task_id.body | jq('.products') | first }}` and any other output parsing expression using the built-in expressions evaluator on the **Outputs** page:

![Debug Outputs](/docs/tutorial/outputs/eval_expressions.png)

## Passing data between tasks

Let's add another task to the flow to process the CSV file generated by the Python script task. We will use the `io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query` task to run a SQL query on the CSV file and store the result as a downloadable artifact in the internal storage.

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: https://dummyjson.com/products

  - id: python
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: python:slim
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install polars
    warningOnStdErr: false
    outputFiles:
      - "products.csv"
    script: |
      import polars as pl
      data = {{ outputs.api.body | jq('.products') | first }}
      df = pl.from_dicts(data)
      df.glimpse()
      df.select(["brand", "price"]).write_csv("products.csv")

  - id: sqlQuery
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    inputFiles:
      in.csv: "{{ outputs.python.outputFiles['products.csv'] }}"
    sql: |
      SELECT brand, round(avg(price), 2) as avg_price
      FROM read_csv_auto('{{ workingDir }}/in.csv', header=True)
      GROUP BY brand
      ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
    store: true
```

This example flow passes data between tasks using outputs. The `inputFiles` argument of the `io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query` task allows you to pass files from internal storage to the task. The `store: true` ensures that the result of the SQL query is stored in the internal storage and can be previewed and downloaded from the Outputs tab.

To sum up, our flow extracts data from an API, uses that data in a Python script, executes a SQL query and generates a downloadable artifact.

::alert{type="info"}
If you encounter any issues while executing the above flow, this might be a Docker related issue (e.g. Docker-in-Docker setup, which might be difficult to configure on Windows). Set the runner property to `PROCESS` to run the Python script task in the same process as the flow rather than in a Docker container, as shown in the example below. This will avoid any Docker related issues.
::

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: api_url
    type: STRING
    defaults: https://dummyjson.com/products

tasks:
  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: "{{ inputs.api_url }}"

  - id: python
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install polars
    warningOnStdErr: false
    outputFiles:
      - "products.csv"
    script: |
      import polars as pl
      data = {{ outputs.api.body | jq('.products') | first }}
      df = pl.from_dicts(data)
      df.glimpse()
      df.select(["brand", "price"]).write_csv("products.csv")

  - id: sqlQuery
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    inputFiles:
      in.csv: "{{ outputs.python.outputFiles['products.csv'] }}"
    sql: |
      SELECT brand, round(avg(price), 2) as avg_price
      FROM read_csv_auto('{{ workingDir }}/in.csv', header=True)
      GROUP BY brand
      ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
    store: true
```
