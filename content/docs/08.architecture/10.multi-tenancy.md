Multi-tenancy allows you to manage **multiple environments** (e.g., dev, staging, prod) in a single Kestra instance.

## What is multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy is a software architecture in which a single instance of software serves multiple tenants. You can think of it as running multiple virtual instances in a single physical instance. You can use multi-tenancy to **separate resources** between business units, teams, or customers.

This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).

## How does multi-tenancy work in Kestra

Starting from Kestra 0.23, multi-tenancy is enabled by default and required. All resources (such as flows, triggers, executions, RBAC, and more) are isolated by the tenant. This means that you can have a flow with the same identifier and the same namespace in multiple tenants at the same time.

Data stored inside the [Internal Storage](./data-components.md#internal-storage) is also isolated by tenants.

End-users can use the tenant selection dropdown menu from the [UI](../09.ui/index.md) to see tenants they have access to. It allows users to switch between tenants easily. Each UI page also includes the tenant ID in the URL (e.g., `https://demo.kestra.io/ui/yourTenantId/executions/namespace/flow/executionId`.)

Most of [API](../api-reference/index.md) endpoints also include the tenant identifier. The exception to that are instance-level endpoints such as `/configs`, `/license-info` or `/banners` that require a `Superadmin` access.

For example, the URL of the API operation to list flows of the `products` namespace is `/api/v1/{your_tenant_id}/flows/products`. You can check the [Enterprise Edition API Guide](../api-reference/01.enterprise.md) for more information.

Note that tenants must be created upfront, and a user needs to be granted access to use a specific tenant.
