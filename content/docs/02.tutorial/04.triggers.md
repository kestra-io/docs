title: Triggers
---


You used triggers to start a flow. They can be scheduled or triggered by an event.
Kestra core provides three types of triggers:

* [Schedule](../05.developer-guide/08.triggers/01.schedule.md)
  * Trigger your flow based on a cron expression
* [Flow trigger](../05.developer-guide/08.triggers/02.flow.md)
  * Trigger your flow based on another flow end
* [Webhook](../05.developer-guide/08.triggers/03.webhook.md)
  * Trigger your flow based on an HTTP request


Many other triggers are available from the plugins, such as triggers based on file creation or a message queue.

## Defining triggers

The Trigger definition is close to the task definition. We define them in the `triggers` section of the flow. And as a Task, it contains an `id`, a `type`, and some properties related to his type. A Flow can have multiple Triggers.

The below triggers will start the flow every day at 10 am or when the `trigger-flow` flow ends.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: 0 10 * * *
  - id: listenFlow
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
        namespace: io.kestra.tutorial
        flowId: trigger-flow
```

## Add a trigger to your flow

Let's schedule our flow. This trigger will start our flow every monday at 10 am.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: 0 10 * * 1
```

        data = pd.read_csv("data.csv", sep=";")
        data.info()
        sumOfConsumption = data['conso'].sum()
        Kestra.outputs({'sumOfConsumption': int(sumOfConsumption)})
    requirements:
      - pandas
