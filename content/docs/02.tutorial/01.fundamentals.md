## Flows

In Kestra, we define flows using the declarative YAML language.

We identify them by an `id` and a `namespace`. The `id` is a unique identifier inside the [namespace](../03.concepts/01.flows.md#namespace), which is used to group flows. Flows can also have a [description](../05.developer-guide/01.flow.md#document-your-flow) and labels.

```yaml
id: kestra-tutorial
namespace: io.kestra.tutorial
labels:
  env: PRD
description: |
  # Kestra Tutorial
  As you notice, we can use markdown here.
```

Discover more about flows in the [Flows](../05.developer-guide/01.flow.md) section.

## Tasks

We use Tasks to write flows. We define a Task by an `id`, a `type`, and some properties related to its type. Each Task is a step in your Flow that will execute a specific action. For example, you can use a Task to run a Python script.

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: python
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.scripts.Python
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        print("Hello World")
```

At the moment of writing this guide, [Kestra has 290+ tasks](../../plugins/index.md), which can be challenging to remember. That's why we provide an auto-completion feature to help you find the Task you need. Use the shortcut `CTRL or âŒ˜ + SPACE` to activate it.

## Create your first Flow

Now, let's create our first Flow. On the left side of the screen, click on the **Flows** menu.
Then, click on the **Create** button.

![Access flow creation](/docs/tutorial/fundamentals/create-button.png)

Use the following Flow in the Editor, then click the **Save** button.
This Flow will download a CSV file from the French Open Data Portal.

```yaml
id: kestra-tutorial
namespace: io.kestra.tutorial
labels:
  env: PRD
description: |
  # Kestra Tutorial
  As you notice, we can use markdown here.
tasks:
  - id: download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.Download
    uri: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tchiotludo/2b7f28f4f507074e60150aedb028e074/raw/6b6348c4f912e79e3ffccaf944fd019bf51cba30/conso-elec-gaz-annuelle-par-naf-agregee-region.csv"
```

After saving it, you will see a **New Execution** button. Click on it and watch your first Flow running.
