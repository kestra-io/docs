Use the included Gradle task to build the plugin. Then, you can publish it to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com).

## Build a plugin
To build your plugin, execute the `./gradlew shadowJar` command from the plugin directory.

The resulting JAR file will be generated in the `build/libs` directory.

To use this plugin in your Kestra instance, add this JAR to the [Kestra plugins path](../10.administrator-guide/04.server-cli.md#plugins-directory).

## Publish a plugin

Here is how you can publish your plugin to Maven Central.

### GitHub Actions

The plugin template includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to test and publish your plugin. You can extend it by adding any additional testing or deployment steps.

### Publish to Maven Central
The template also include a Gradle task that will publish to Maven Central. You will need to register to Maven Central to be able to publish to it.

You only need to configure the `gradle.properties` to have all required properties:

```yaml
sonatypeUsername=
sonatypePassword=
signing.keyId=
signing.password=
signing.secretKeyRingFile=

```


There is a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file that you can customize to your need:
```yaml
      # Publish
      - name: Publish package to Sonatype
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
        env:
          ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
          ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
        run: |
          echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
          ./gradlew publishToSonatype

      # Release
      - name: Release package to Maven Central
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
        env:
          ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
          ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
          SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
        run: |
          echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
          echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
          ./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
```
