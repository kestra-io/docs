title: Tenants
---

A tenant represents an **isolated environment within a single Kestra instance**. Each tenant functions as a separate entity with its own resources, such as flows, triggers, or executions. Multi-tenancy enables different teams, projects, or customers to operate independently within the same Kestra instance, ensuring data privacy, security along with separation of resources between business units, teams, or customers. For example, you can have a `dev` tenant for development, a `staging` tenant for testing, and a `prod` tenant for production.

You can think of multi-tenancy as running multiple virtual instances in a single physical instance of [Kestra Cloud](02.cloud.md) or [Kestra Enterprise Edition](01.enterprise.md).
::

When multi-tenancy is enabled, all resources (such as flows, triggers, executions, [RBAC](RBAC/index.md), and more) are isolated by the tenant. This means that you can have a flow with the same identifier and the same namespace in multiple tenants at the same time.

Data stored inside the internal storage are also isolated by tenants.

Multi-tenancy functionality is not visible to end-users from the UI except for the tenant selection dropdown menu. That dropdown menu lists all tenants a user has access to, allowing to switch between tenants easily. Each UI page also includes the tenant ID in the URL e.g. `https://demo.kestra.io/ui/yourTenantId/executions/namespace/flow/executionId`.

The API URLs also include the tenant identifier. For example, the URL of the API operation to list flows of the `marketing` namespace is `/api/v1/flows/marketing` when multi-tenancy is not enabled. Once you enable multi-tenancy and create a tenant `prod`, this URL becomes `/api/v1/prod/flows/marketing`. You can check the [API Guide](../12.api-guide/api-ee-guide.md) for more information.

Tenants must be created upfront, and a user needs to be granted access to use a specific tenant.

## Key Benefits of Multi-Tenancy

1. **Environment Management**: you can manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) within a single Kestra instance.
2. **Data Isolation**: each tenant's data, configuration and code are isolated and inaccessible to others.
3. **Resource Isolation**: each tenant's resources are isolated from other tenants â€” incl. flows, triggers, executions, logs, audit logs, secrets, etc.
4. **Simple Configuration**: you can easily create new tenants giving you instantly a fresh, fully-isolated workspace accessible from your existing Kestra instance.
5. **Intuitive UI Navigation**: the UI provides a dropdown and tenant identifiers included in the URL to make switching between tenants seamless.

## Creating and Managing Tenants

Tenants in Kestra can be managed in various ways: from the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform.

### Creating a Tenant from the UI

Tenants can be created and managed directly through Kestra's user interface. Go to **Administration -> Tenants**. Then, click on the **Create** button:
![create tenant from the UI](/docs/kestra-editions/tenant-create.png)

Fill in the form and click **Save**:
![create tenant from the UI](/docs/kestra-editions/tenant-create-2.png)

### Creating a Tenant from the CLI

Kestra provides CLI commands for tenant creation:

```bash
kestra tenants create stage --name "staging"
```
The above command will create a tenant with the identifier `stage` and the name `staging`.

Running `kestra tenants create --help` will show you all available properties:

```bash
Usage: kestra-ee tenants create [-hVv] [--internal-log]
                                [--admin-username=<adminUser>] [-c=<config>]
                                [-l=<logLevel>] [--name=<tenantName>]
                                [-p=<pluginsPath>] [--tenant=<tenantId>]
create a tenant and assign admin roles to an existing admin user
      --admin-username=<adminUser>
                            Username of an existing admin user that will be
                              admin of this tenant
  -c, --config=<config>     Path to a configuration file, default: /Users/anna/.
                              kestra/config.yml)
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
      --internal-log        Change also log level for internal log, default:
                              false)
  -l, --log-level=<logLevel>
                            Change log level (values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
                              ERROR; default: INFO)
      --name=<tenantName>   tenant description
  -p, --plugins=<pluginsPath>
                            Path to plugins directory , default:
                              /Users/anna/dev/plugins)
      --tenant=<tenantId>   tenant identifier
  -v, --verbose             Change log level. Multiple -v options increase the
                              verbosity.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
```

### Creating a Tenant from the API

Tenants can be managed programmatically via Kestra's [API](https://kestra.io/docs/api-guide/api-ee-guide#post-/api/v1/tenants). Here is an example of an API call for creating a tenant:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://demo.kestra.io/api/v1/tenants" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{ \"id\": \"stage\", \"name\": \"staging\", \"deleted\": false}"
```

### Creating a Tenant from Terraform
Tenants can be managed via Infrastructure as Code using [Kestra's Terraform provider](https://kestra.io/docs/terraform/resources/tenant). Here is an example of a Terraform configuration for creating a tenant:

```terraform
resource "kestra_tenant" "example" {
  tenant_id = "stage"
  name      = "staging"
}
```

### Admin Role Assignment

Regardless of which of the above methods you use to create a tenant, the User who creates the tenant will automatically get the [Admin Role](RBAC/02.admins.md#admin) assigned. That role grants admin rights to that user on that tenant.

Note that there is an exception to this rule if tenant is created by a User with a [Super Admin Role](RBAC/02.admins.md#super-admin). In that case, the Super Admin will have to explicitly assign the Admin Role for that tenant to themselves or any other User, Service Account or Group.

## How to Enable Multi-Tenancy

By default, multi-tenancy is disabled in the [Enterprise Edition](01.enterprise.md)]. Add the following configuration to enable multi-tenancy:

```yaml
kestra:
  ee:
    tenants:
      enabled: true
```


### Default Tenant

When enabling multi-tenancy, you can also decide whether to enable the default tenant or not. Default tenant is a tenant without an identifier (aka the null tenant). It exists for backward compatibility when multi-tenancy is enabled in an existing Kestra instance. If you disable the default tenant in a Kestra instance that already has flows and executions, you will no longer be able to access them.

When multi-tenancy is enabled in a new Kestra instance, **it's recommended to disable the default tenant** so that all tenants will have an identifier. This way, all tenants are explicitly defined and can be referenced by their ID.

Here is how to enable multi-tenancy and disable the default tenant (best practice):

```yaml
kestra:
  ee:
    tenants:
      enabled: true
      default-tenant: false
```


::alert{type="info"}
Note that in [Kestra Cloud](02.cloud.md), multi-tenancy is automatically enabled and the default tenant is disabled.
::

Once multi-tenancy is enabled, you can create one or more tenants e.g. from the UI, CLI, Terraform or API. Then, you can assign user roles and permissions within each tenant.
