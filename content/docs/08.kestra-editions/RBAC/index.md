title: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
---

Kestra Enterprise supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to manage access to workflows and resources by assigning [Roles](01.roles.md) to [Users, Groups and Service Accounts](03.users.md) through the **Access page**.

The image below shows the relationship between Users, Groups, Service Accounts, Roles, and Bindings (visible on the Access page in the UI).
