title: Admin Roles
---

Kestra doesn't have a concept of an admin user. Instead, it has an **Instance Admin** and a tenant-scoped **Admin** roles, which can be assigned to any User, Service Account or Group. This means that you can have multiple users with admin permissions, and you can revoke those admin permissions at any time without having to delete the user.

---

## Admin

The Admin role has full access to all resources in a specific tenant. This includes managing users, service accounts, groups, roles, and their tenant-level permissions. By default, Kestra assigns the Admin Role to the user who created a tenant.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that Admin is **NOT a User**, but a **Role**. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission.
::

Users with an `Admin` role in a given tenant:
- cannot see all workers in the Instance, you'd need the `Instance Admin` role to see workers
- cannot directly change the password or email address of any User for privacy reasons; instead, they can only reset the password and send a mandatory reset-password request to the user
- cannot see all Users existing in the instance for privacy reasons
- can automatically send a **reset-password request** to any User, Service Account or Group in that tenant
- can invite Users (already existing in the instance) to that tenant by adding them to a Group or by assigning a Role to them. When selecting the user from the dropdown and typing the exact email address, the user will become visible and can be added to the tenant. That User or Service Account will then also be visible in the Users or Service Accounts page for that tenant, even if it has not been originally created in that tenant.

The Admin role can also create new Users or Service Accounts, modify or remove tenant-level access for existing Users or Service Accounts, and reset their passwords.

::alert{type="info"}
If you see an error when creating a new User or Service Account, it might be caused by a limit of your license. In that case, [reach out to us](https://kestra.io/contact-us) to validate and optionally upgrade your license.

### Creating a User with an Admin Role from the UI

Go to **Administration -> Users**. Then, click on the **Create** button and assign the `Admin` Role to the User.


### Creating a User with an Admin Role from the CLI

To create a User with an Admin Role from the CLI, use the `--admin` boolean flag along with `--tenant` property with the tenant ID (here `prod`):

```bash
kestra auths users create prod.admin@kestra.io TopSecret42 \
--tenant=prod --admin

# schema: select either `--admin` or `--instance-admin`:
kestra auths users create <username> <password> \
--tenant=<tenant-id> --admin --instance-admin
```

## Instance Admin

A user with an Instance Admin role has full access to all resources in a specific tenant from which it was created. Additionally, it has permissions to manage tenants and tenant admins, as well as centrally govern Roles, Groups, and Users on the instance level (i.e. across all tenants). However, this is not a super-admin role, as it cannot access user data in other tenants, such as flows, executions, logs, audit logs, etc.

::alert{type="info"}
Except for the `Instance Admin`, all Roles are always tied to one and only one [tenant ID](../03.tenants.md). We currently don’t provide any cross-tenant RBAC permissions. However, when configuring permissions using [our Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kestra-io/kestra/latest), you can add modules to reuse the same configuration across tenants to achieve the same effect without duplicating the configuration.
::

The only difference between an **Admin** and an **Instance Admin** roles is that the **Instance Admin** also has the `TENANTS` permission. This extra permission grants access to manage tenants within a Kestra Enterprise instance.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that Instance Admin is **NOT a User**, but a **Role**. This means that there can be multiple users with that permission.
::

A User with an `Instance Admin` Role can:
- create new tenants
- remove tenants
- modify tenant settings
- create new Users, Service Accounts, and Groups
- assign roles to users across all tenants in the instance incl. the `Admin` and `Instance Admin` roles
- do anything in their tenant: manage users, groups, roles, flows, executions, logs, audit logs etc.

A User with an `Instance Admin` Role cannot:
- access user data in other tenants, such as flows, executions, logs, audit logs, etc.

The Tenants page provides an instance-level overview of existing Tenants, Roles, as well as Users, Service Accounts, and Groups across the Enterprise Edition installation. This view is visible only to Instance Admins.

### Creating a User with Instance Admin Role from the UI

When launching the Kestra Enterprise Edition for the first time, you will see a welcome screen allowing you to create a first User if you don't have one already. This User will automatically be assigned the `Instance Admin` Role.

### Creating a User with Instance Admin Role from the CLI

To create a User with an Instance Admin Role from the CLI, use the `--instance-admin` property:

```bash
kestra auths users create prod.admin@kestra.io TopSecret42 \
--tenant=prod --instance-admin

# schema: select either `--admin` or `--instance-admin`:
kestra auths users create <username> <password> \
--tenant=<tenant-id> --admin --instance-admin
```

If you use the same command as above, but change the `--instance-admin` flag to just `--admin`, the user will be created with the `Tenant Admin` Role instead.

Note that only a user with an `Instance Admin` role can grant a Role with `TENANT` or `ROLE` permissions. A user with an `Admin` role **cannot** grant a `TENANT` permission:
  - If you want to give a role with `TENANT` permission to someone, you also need to have a `TENANT` permission
  - If you want to give a role with `ROLE` permission to someone, you also need to have a `TENANT` permission, as otherwise, someone could grant themselves or someone else a `TENANT` permission.
