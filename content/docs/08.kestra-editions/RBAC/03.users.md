title: Users, Groups and Service Accounts
---

Users and Service Accounts are two different types of users that can access Kestra. Each `User` represents a **person**, while each `Service Account` represents an **application** that can access Kestra resources.

Both `Users` and `Service Accounts` can be directly assigned one or more `Roles` defining their permission boundaries. `Users` and `Service Accounts` can also be assigned to `Groups`, and those `Groups` can be assigned one or more `Roles` as well. Groups are especially useful to provide the same permissions to multiple Users or Service Accounts at once by assigning a single Role to a Group.

The image below shows the relationship between Users, Groups, Roles, and Bindings.

## Groups

Each `Group` is a collection of zero, one or more `Users` or `Service Accounts`.
- Each `User` can be assigned to zero, one or more `Groups` as a **Group Owner** or **Group Member**.
- Each `Service Account` can also be assigned to zero, one or more `Groups` as a **Group Owner** or **Group Member**.

Technically speaking, Groups don't have Users or Service Accounts. Instead, Users or Service Accounts can be _attached_ to Groups. As soon as a User or a Service Account gets attached to a Group, you’ll see them listed in the `Members` or `Owners` tab in the UI. You can attach Users or Service Accounts **from the Group page**, or you can attach a Group to a given Users or Service Accounts **from the Users or Service Accounts pages** — both options are equivalent.

You can think of a Group as a category label that you can attach to a collection of Users or Service Accounts. Groups are a useful mechanism providing the same permissions to multiple Users or Service Accounts at once by assigning a single Role to a Group.

**What happens if you delete a Group?** The assignment of User to Group will be deleted as well, but the user will still exist because the User is independent of a Group. Group acts as a label of users from the same _family_.

**How to attach permissions to a User or Group?** You need to create a Role first. Then you can attach that Role to a User or Group. You can also limit that Role to one or more namespaces.

**How many Roles can a User or Group have?** A User or Group can have zero, one or more Roles attached, giving specific permissions, optionally tied to one or more namespaces.

## Users

A User represents a **person** who can access Kestra, identified by an email address. Each user might have personal information attached to it, such as the first name or last name.

Each User can be assigned one or more Roles, which define what resources the User can access. `User` can be a developer writing flows, operator running flows, viewer only viewing execution states or run artifacts. The combination of Permissions and Actions specified in a Role determine what the user can do.

Note that Users and Groups don’t belong to namespaces, but their Roles can be limited to specific namespaces via Bindings (Access page).

A `User` without a `Tenant Admin` or `Instance Admin` Role will not see the Administration and IAM views listing all Users, Groups, Service Accounts, Roles, and Bindings. They can change their own password, and adjust other settings such as theme, editor preferences, timezone, and a default namespace per tenant. The profiles bound to a tenant allow each user to save their preferences per tenant allowing configuring default preferences per environment.


### Forgot password (initiated by the user)

If the user forgot their password, they can reset it by clicking on the `Forgot Password` button on the login screen. This will send an email with a secure link to change the password. The user can also change their password from their Settings page.


### Reset password (initiated by the admin)

Neither Instance nor Tenant Admin can change a user's password arbitrarily. However, both Admins can issue a `change password request` which will send an email to one or more selected users with a secure link to change the password. This is useful in the following use cases:

1. Security breach - specific passwords must be reset
2. Password rotation policy - e.g. a compliance policy requires all passwords to be rotated every 90 days
3. Employee departure or customer churn - the admin can immediately reset their password and keep the user account to keep the audit logs, or delete the user account later.

## Service Accounts

A Service Account represents an **application** that can access Kestra. It is not tied to a specific person, and does not have personal information (such as first name, last name or email) attached to it. Instead, it only has an ID, an OAuth token and an optional expiration date for that token. The token is automatically generated by Kestra. The Service Account can be granted Roles with fine-grained Permissions bound to one or more specific namespace(s).

Each Service Account can be attached to one or more Groups e.g. a group “Bots” that centrally governs programmatic access for CI/CD across multiple projects with just one Role. This is useful to manage programmatic access used by Terraform, GitHub Action, or other external applications, in one place by attaching a single Role to that Group.

Speaking of CI/CD, note that currently Kestra supports authenticating with both Basic Authentication User, as well as with a Service Account's token:

1. Use the `--token=mytoken` CLI property to allow authenticating with a service account token, e.g.:

```
./kestra namespace files update prod scripts . \
--server=https://demo.kestra.io --token yourtoken
```

2. Use the `--user user_email:password` flag to the CLI to allow authenticating with a Basic Authentication access, e.g.:

```
./kestra namespace files update prod scripts . \
--server=https://demo.kestra.io --user=rick.astely@kestra.io:password42
```
