## Why a Service Account is not just one type of User?

Service Account is not a User, but a collection of Permissions and an OAuth token associated with it to allow an external application (such as Terraform or GitHub Actions) to assume programmatic access to Kestra resources. You can think of a Service Account as an application that is granted permissions to perform actions on behalf of a user.

## Why Instance Admin or Tenant Admin are Roles rather than Users?

Becuase they can be assumed by multiple users or groups, and because some user may initially be a "normal" user and be later granted a higher permission; in the same way, some user may initially be an Admin but then this user may lose Admin Role access. The Admin Roles enables all these patterns in a flexible way.
