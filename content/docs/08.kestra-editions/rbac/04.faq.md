## Why a Service Account is not just one type of User?

Service Account is not a User, but a collection of Permissions and an OAuth token associated with it to allow an external application (such as Terraform or GitHub Actions) to assume programmatic access to Kestra resources. You can think of a Service Account as an application that is granted permissions to perform actions on behalf of a user.

## Why Admin and Super Admin are Roles rather than Users?

Becuase they can be assumed by multiple users or groups, and because some user may be later granted a higher permission; in the same way, some user may initially be an Admin but then their permission may be revoked. The Admin Roles enables all these patterns in a flexible way.

You can think of Users as **authentication** mechanism (who you are), and Roles as **authorization** mechanism (what you are allowed to do). Decoupling authentication from authorization allows you to grant permissions to multiple users or groups at once by attaching a single Role to a Group.
