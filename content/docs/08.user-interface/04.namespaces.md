Starting 0.18.0, Kestra has introduced the Namespaces tab in the Kestra UI for OSS. In this tab, you can see all the namespaces associated with the different flows in Kestra.

On the top of this page, you have different tabs:

1. **Overview:** This is the default landing page of the Namespace. This page contains the dashboards and summary about the executions of different flows in this namespace.

2. **Editor:** the in-built editor where you can add/edit the namespaceFiles.

3. **Flows:** shows all the flows in the namespace. It gives a brief about each of the flows including the flow ID, labels, last execution date and last execution status, and the execution statistics. By selecting the details button on the right of the flow, you can navigate to that flow's page.

4. **Dependencies:** shows all the flows and which ones are dependent on each other (for example through Subflows or Flow Triggers).

4. **KV Store:** manage the key-values pairs associated with this namespace. More details on KV Store can be found [here](../05.concepts/05.kv-store.md).

The other tabs: Edit, Variables, Plugin Defaults, Secrets and Audit Logs are only available for Kestra EE. More details about them can be found [here](/enterprise).

When first accessing the **Namespaces** page, you will see the list of all Kestra flow namespaces (including parents, as namespaces are hierarchical like a directory tree), but you will not be able to configure a namespace before creating it.

You can click on the **Create** button at the top right on the Namespaces page to create it.

After creating a namespace, you can configure it:

- The **Variables** tab allows setting Namespace Variables.
- The **plugin defaults** tab allows setting task default scoped to a namespace.
- The **Secrets** tab allows setting Namespace Secrets
- The **Groups**, **Roles**, and **Access** tabs allow managing role-based access control.
- The **Service accounts** tab allows managing service accounts to access Kestra as a service, and not as an end user.
- The **Audit Logs** tab allows access to the audit logs of the namespace.
