This document will guide you through setting up Kestra in a few minutes and creating your first flow.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following is installed:
- Docker, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is the easiest way to use it.

## Run Kestra

### Download Docker Compose file

Download the Docker Compose file for Kestra using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have curl installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

### Start your server

Make sure the Docker is up and running. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Networking in this docker compose

The above docker-compose file doesn't specify anything regarding the network of Kestra's service.

This means that as it is, you won't be able to access any of your localhost exposed services (eg. another docker container with a mapped port) even if you're able to reach it from your machine.

If you plan to use local services and reach them from Kestra, you have four options:
- Depending on your docker implementation, you should be able to use the `host.docker.internal` hostname or `172.17.0.1` to reach your host machine from inside Kestra's container.
- By default, your container will be in a `default` network. You can add your other services in the above `docker-compose.yml` file and use the services' alias (keys from `services`) to reach them.
- You can create a new network and add your services to it. Then you can add this network to the `networks` section of the `kestra` service. With this, you will have access via `localhost` to all your exposed ports.
- You can use the `host` network mode for the `kestra` service. This will make your container use your host network and you will be able to reach all your exposed ports. This means you have to change the `services.kestra.environment.KESTRA_CONFIGURATION.datasources.postgres.url` to `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra`. This is the easiest way but it can be a security risk.

## Create your first flow

In the **Flow** menu, click the "Create" button and paste the following flow:

```yaml
id: getting-started
namespace: io.kestra.tutorial
tasks:
  - id: log-task
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: Hello World !
```

When you're done, click on the **Save** button to save it and start your first execution via the **Create Execution** button.

## Next Steps

Now, you're ready to use Kestra! :rocket:

As next steps, we suggest reading the following documentation in this order:
- Follow the [tutorial](./02.tutorial/index.md) and create your first flow with all the Kestra possibilities!
- Learn Kestra [concepts](./03.concepts/index.md).
- Read the [Developer Guide](./05.developer-guide/index.md) to understand how to build your own flows.
- Look at [Plugins](../plugins/index.md) to perform some real tasks.
- [Deploy](./09.administrator-guide/index.md) your Kestra instance to real environments.
