Start Kestra using Docker-Compose and create your first flow.

**Prerequisites**: Make sure that Docker is installed in your environment. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Start Kestra


Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.


Make sure that Docker is running. Then, use the following command to start Kestra server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to launch the UI.

If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](14.troubleshooting.md).
