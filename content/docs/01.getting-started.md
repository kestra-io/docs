This document will guide you through setting up Kestra in a few minutes and creating your first flow.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following is installed:
- Docker, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is the easiest way to use it.

## Run Kestra

### Download Docker Compose file

Download the Docker Compose file for Kestra using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have curl installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

### Start your server

Make sure the Docker is up and running. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](14.troubleshooting.md).


## Create your first flow

In the **Flow** menu, click the "Create" button and paste the following flow:

```yaml
id: getting-started
namespace: io.kestra.tutorial
tasks:
  - id: log-task
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: Hello World !
```

When you're done, click on the **Save** button to save it and start your first execution via the **Create Execution** button.
