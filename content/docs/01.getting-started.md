title: ðŸš€ Getting started

Start Kestra using Docker-Compose and create your first flow.

::alert{type="info"}
**Prerequisites**: Make sure that Docker is installed in your environment. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
::

## Start Kestra

Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:develop-full server local
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flows.

::alert{type="info"}
The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with Postgres and more configurability, use Docker Compose instead as shown in the next section.
::

---

## Start Kestra with Postgres using Docker Compose

Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.


Then, use the following command to start Kestra server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to launch the UI.


::alert{type="info"}
If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](14.troubleshooting.md).

## Create Your First Flow

Navigate to **Flows** in the left menu, then click the "Create" button and paste the following configuration to create your first flow:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: hello_world
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: Hello World!
```

Click on **Save** and start your first execution via the **Create Execution** button.
