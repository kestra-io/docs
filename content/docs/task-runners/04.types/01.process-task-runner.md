## How to use the Process task runner

The following example shows a Shell script configured with the Process task runner, which runs a Shell command as a child process on the Kestra host:

```yaml
id: process_task_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

The [Process task runner](/plugins/core/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.process) does not require any additional configuration beyond the `type` property.

By default, Python is the only programming language installed in the Kestra Docker image. To use other languages, ensure their dependencies are installed on your local machine if running Kestra manually, or inside your container if running via Docker.

## Benefits

The Process task runner is useful when you need to access local files or take advantage of locally configured software libraries and virtual environments.

## Combining task runners with Worker Groups

You can combine the Process task runner with [Worker Groups](../../07.enterprise/04.scalability/worker-group.md) to run tasks on dedicated servers that have specific software libraries or configurations. This combination allows you to leverage the compute resources of your Worker Groups while running tasks as local processes, without the overhead of containerization.

The following example demonstrates how to combine the Process task runner with Worker Groups to fully leverage the GPU resources of a dedicated server:

```yaml
id: python_on_gpu
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: gpu_intensive_ai_workload
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    commands:
      - python main.py
    workerGroup:
      key: gpu
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
```

Note that Worker Groups are an Enterprise Edition feature. To try them out, please [reach out](/demo).
