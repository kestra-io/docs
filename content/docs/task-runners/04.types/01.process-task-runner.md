## How to use the Process task runner

Here is an example of a Shell script configured with the Process task runner which runs a Shell command as a child process in the Kestra host:

```yaml
id: process_script_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

The [Process task runner](/plugins/core/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.process) doesnâ€™t have any additional configuration beyond the `type` property.

## Benefits

The Process task runner is useful if you want to access local files e.g. to take advantage of locally configured software libraries and virtual environments.

## Combining task runners with Worker Groups

You can combine the Process task runner with [Worker Groups](../../06.enterprise/worker-group.md) to run tasks on dedicated servers that might have specific software libraries or configurations. This powerful combination allows you to leverage the compute resources of your Worker Groups while running tasks as local processes without the overhead of containerization.

The example below shows how to combine the Process task runner with Worker Groups to fully leverage the GPU resources of a dedicated server:

```yaml
id: python_on_gpu
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: gpu_intensive_ai_workload
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    commands:
      - python main.py
    workerGroup:
      key: gpu
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
```

Note that Worker Group is an Enterprise Edition functionality. If you want to try it out, please [reach out](/demo).
