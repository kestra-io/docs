## How to use the Docker task runner

The following example shows how to use the Docker task runner to execute commands in a Docker container:

```yaml
id: docker_task_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    containerImage: centos
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

Once you specify the `taskRunner` type, you get autocompletion and validation for the runner-specific properties. In the example above, the task allocates one CPU to the container.

## Docker task runner properties

The only property required by the `taskRunner` is the `containerImage` property, which must be set on the script task. The image can be from a public or private registry.

Additionally, when using the Docker task runner, you can configure memory allocation, volumes, environment variables, and more. For a full list of available properties, refer to the [Docker plugin documentation](/plugins/plugin-script-python/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker) or explore them in the built-in Code Editor in the Kestra UI.

:::alert{type="info"}
The Docker task runner executes the script task as a container in a Docker-compatible engine. This means you can use it to run scripts within a Kubernetes cluster using Docker-In-Docker (DinD) or in a local Docker engine.

## Task runner behavior in a failure scenario

In general, each task runner container initiated by Kestra will **continue running until the task completes**, even if the Kestra worker is terminated (for example, due to a crash). However, there are a few caveats depending on how Kestra and the task runner are deployed.

### Kestra running in a Docker container, task runner running in DinD

When Kestra runs in a Docker container and uses DinD for task runners, terminating the Kestra container will also terminate the DinD container and any running task containers inside it. No container is automatically restarted.

### Kestra running in Kubernetes, task runner running in DinD

When Kestra and DinD are deployed in the same pod in a Kubernetes environment, the pod will restart if the Kestra Worker fails. This ensures that both the DinD container and any task runner containers are restarted.

### Kestra deployed with Docker Compose, task runner running in DinD

When using Docker Compose, Kestra and DinD containers can be managed independently. Restarting the Kestra container does **not** automatically restart the DinD container. Therefore, task runners running inside DinD may continue running even if Kestra is restarted.

## Insecure registry

The Docker task runner relies on the Docker daemon for registry configuration. If you need to use an insecure (HTTP) registry, it must be configured at the **daemon level**, not within the task or flow â€” make sure that the insecure registry is configured on the host machine where your Kestra server is running.

For example, if your registry is at `10.10.1.5:5000`, add the following to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, then restart the Docker daemon:

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["10.10.1.5:5000"]
}
```

Important notes:
* Do **not** include `http://` or `https://` in the registry address.
* The `insecure-registries` setting cannot be provided in the task configuration; it has no effect there.
* Restart the Docker daemon after updating this file.

You can then reference your registry directly in the flow:

```yaml
id: docker_example
namespace: demo

tasks:
  - id: my_command
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
    containerImage: 10.10.1.5:5000/my-image
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```
