title: Develop your FlowableTask
---

[Flowable tasks](../03.concepts/flowable-tasks.md) are the most complex tasks to develop, and will usually be available from the Kestra core. You will rarely need to create a flowable task by yourself.

::alert{type="warning"}
When developing such tasks, you must make it fault-tolerant as an exception thrown by a flowable task can endanger the Kestra instance and lead to inconsistencies in the flow execution.

Keep in mind that a flowable task will be evaluated very frequently inside the Executor and must be low CPU usage; no I/O should be done by this kind of task.

In the future, complete documentation will be available here. In the meantime, you can find all the actual Flowable tasks [here](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/tree/develop/core/src/main/java/io/kestra/core/tasks/flows) to have some inspiration for Sequential or Parallel tasks development.
