title: Build a plugin
---

Kestra plugin template includes a Gradle task for building your plugin.

Use `./gradlew shadowJar` to build your plugin.

The resulting JAR file will be generated to the `build/libs` directory.

Just drop this JAR on the [Kestra plugins path](../09.administrator-guide/04.servers.md#plugins-directory) and it will be usable by your Kestra instance.
