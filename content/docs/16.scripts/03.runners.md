Manage the environment your code is executed with `runner`.

Kestra supports two runners for scripting tasks: `DOCKER` and `PROCESS`.

::alert{type="info"}
The `runner` property is being replaced with Task Runners to give you more control and flexibility. Read more in the [Task Runners documentation](../task-runners/index.md).
::

You can configure your scripts to run either in local **processes** or in **Docker containers** by using the `runner` property:

1. By default, all scripting tasks run in isolated containers using the `DOCKER` runner.
2. Setting the `runner` property to `PROCESS` executes your task in a local process on the worker without relying on Docker for container isolation.

## runner: DOCKER

Docker is the default option for all script tasks. There are many arguments that can be provided here, including credentials to private Docker registries:

```yaml
id: python_in_container
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: cloneRepository
        type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/examples
        branch: main

      - id: gitPythonScripts
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
        warningOnStdErr: false
        outputFiles:
          - "*.csv"
          - "*.parquet"
        commands:
          - python scripts/etl_script.py
        runner: DOCKER
        docker:
          image: annageller/kestra:latest
          config: |
            {
              "auths": {
                  "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
                      "username": "annageller",
                      "password": "{{ secret('DOCKER_PAT') }}"
                  }
              }
            }
```

## runner: PROCESS

The `PROCESS` runner is useful if your Kestra instance is running locally without Docker, and you want to access your local files and environments, for example, to take advantage of locally configured Conda virtual environments.

```yaml
id: local_python_script
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: conda_example
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    beforeCommands:
      - conda activate myCondaEnv
    commands:
      - python /Users/you/scripts/etl_script.py
```

Running scripts in a local process is particularly beneficial when using remote Worker Groups. The example below ensures that a script is picked up only by Kestra workers that have been started with the key `gpu`, effectively delegating processing of scripts that require demanding computational requirements to the right server, rather than running them directly in a local container:

```yaml
id: gpu_task
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: gpu
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - python ml_on_gpu.py
    workerGroup:
      key: gpu
```
