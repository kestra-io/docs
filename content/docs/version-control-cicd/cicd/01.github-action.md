Use GitHub Actions to automate the validation and deployment of your Kestra flows.

## Overview

Kestra provides two official [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that let you build a CI/CD pipeline directly within your GitHub repository. These actions allow you to validate and deploy flows automatically every time you push updates to your version control system.

In GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines are called **Workflows** — sequences of **Actions** that execute validation and deployment steps.  
To use these Actions, your Kestra instance must be accessible to the GitHub Actions runner — either publicly over the internet or through a **self-hosted runner** within your network.

For flows managed through CI/CD, add the [`system.readOnly`](../../06.concepts/system-labels.md#systemreadonly) label set to `"true"` so the UI editor is disabled and production configurations stay immutable. This is especially recommended for critical production flows:

```yaml
labels:
  system.readOnly: true
```

## Official Kestra Actions

Kestra provides two dedicated Actions to integrate with GitHub CI/CD pipelines:

* [**Kestra Validate Action**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kestra-validate-action) — Validate your flows and templates before deployment.  
* [**Kestra Deploy Action**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kestra-deploy-action) — Deploy validated flows and templates to your Kestra server.

## Input reference

### Validate Action inputs

| Input          | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `directory`    | ✅ | — | Folder containing your resources. |
| `resource`     | ✅ | — | Resource type to validate — `flow` or `template`. |
| `server`       | ❌ | — | URL of your Kestra server. If omitted, validation runs locally. |
| `user`         | ❌ | — | Username for basic authentication. |
| `password`     | ❌ | — | Password for basic authentication. |
| `apiToken`     | ❌ | — | API token for Enterprise Edition authentication. |
| `tenant`       | ❌ | — | Tenant identifier (Enterprise Edition only). |

---

### Deploy Action inputs

| Input          | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `namespace`    | ✅ | — | Namespace containing your flows and templates. |
| `directory`    | ✅ | — | Folder containing your resources. |
| `resource`     | ✅ | — | Resource type to deploy — `flow`, `template`, or `namespace_files`. |
| `server`       | ✅ | — | URL of your Kestra server. |
| `user`         | ❌ | — | Username for basic authentication. |
| `password`     | ❌ | — | Password for basic authentication. |
| `delete`       | ❌ | `true` | If `true`, flows not found in the directory will be deleted from the server. Set to `false` to preserve them. |
| `tenant`       | ❌ | — | Tenant identifier (Enterprise Edition only). |
| `to`           | ❌ | — | Remote path where namespace files should be uploaded. |

## Example workflow

The following GitHub Actions workflow validates all flows and then deploys them to multiple namespaces when changes are pushed to the repository.

```yaml
name: Kestra CI/CD
on: [push]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Validate Kestra flows
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate flows on server-side
        uses: kestra-io/validate-action@develop
        with:
          directory: ./kestra/flows
          resource: flow
          server: ${{ secrets.KESTRA_HOSTNAME }}

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy Kestra flows
    needs: validate
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Deploy to product namespace
      - name: Deploy product flows
        uses: kestra-io/deploy-action@master
        with:
          namespace: product
          directory: ./kestra/flows/product
          resource: flow
          server: ${{ secrets.KESTRA_HOSTNAME }}

      # Deploy to engineering namespace
      - name: Deploy engineering flows
        uses: kestra-io/deploy-action@master
        with:
          namespace: engineering
          directory: ./kestra/flows/engineering
          resource: flow
          server: ${{ secrets.KESTRA_HOSTNAME }}
```

:::alert{type="info"}
**Tips:**  
- Store your Kestra server credentials as **GitHub Secrets** to keep them secure.  
- The example uses the `server` input directly, but you can also authenticate using an **API token** instead of a username and password:

```yaml
with:
  server: ${{ secrets.KESTRA_HOSTNAME }}
  apiToken: ${{ secrets.KESTRA_API_TOKEN }}
```
