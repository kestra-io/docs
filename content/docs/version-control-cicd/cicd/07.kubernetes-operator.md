How to use the Kestra Kubernetes Operator to provision and manage changes to Kestra resources, including flows, namespace files, and key-value store entries.

:::alert{type="info"}
When you deploy flows through GitOps or CI/CD (including the operator), add the [`system.readOnly`](../../05.concepts/06.system-labels.md#systemreadonly) label set to `"true"` so the UI editor is disabled and production configurations stay immutable. This is especially recommended for critical production flows:

```yaml
labels:
  system.readOnly: true
```

This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).

A **Kubernetes operator** is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of applications or their components on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It is a custom Kubernetes controller that uses custom resources (CR).

To define and manage these components, operators leverage Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). CRDs allow you to extend the Kubernetes API with new resource types that are specific to your application or service.

The Kestra Kubernetes Operator manages Kestra flows, namespace files, and key-value store entries as Kubernetes resources.

## Installing the Kestra Kubernetes Operator

We provide a Helm chart to install Kestra in Kubernetes; see the [installation guide](../../02.installation/03.kubernetes.md).

This chart can also deploy the Kestra Kubernetes Operator in your cluster.

:::alert{type="info"}
The operator automatically creates and updates Kestra CRDs, so it requires Kubernetes RBAC (service account plus cluster-wide roles) that the Helm chart provisions for you. Contact us if you have concerns or run into issues applying it to your cluster.
:::

Because the operator calls the Kestra API, you must provide credentials—either a [service account](../../06.enterprise/03.auth-rbac-user-management/service-accounts.md) or an [API token](../../06.enterprise/03.auth-rbac-user-management/api-tokens.md)—if authentication is enabled.

To install the Kestra Kubernetes Operator inside your cluster, you need to configure the following properties in your Helm values:

```yaml
operator:
  enabled: true
  apiKey: <your-kestra-api-token>
```

If you prefer to use a service account, please configure the following properties instead:

```yaml
operator:
  enabled: true
  basicAuth: <username:password>
```

Then run `helm install` or `helm upgrade` to roll out the changes to your cluster.

If everything goes well, you will see a `kestra-operator` pod running.

kubectl get po

## Manage Kestra resources via the operator

The Kestra Kubernetes operator watches for three resource types in all namespaces:

- `KestraFlow`, shortname **flow**. To manage [flows](../../04.workflow-components/01.flow.md).
- `KestraKeyValue`, shortnames **keyvalue** or **kv**. To manage [K/V store](../../05.concepts/05.kv-store.md) entries.
- `KestraNamespaceFile`, shortnames **namespacefile** or **nsfile**. To manage [Namespace files](../../05.concepts/02.namespace-files.md).

### Managing Flow resources

Here is an example flow resource that you can create in a `hello-world.yml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: model.kestra.io/v1alpha1
kind: KestraFlow
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  id: hello-world
  namespace: company.team # This is a Kestra namespace, not a Kubernetes namespace
  source: |
   id: hello-world
   namespace: company.team
   tasks:
   - id: hello
     type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
```

:::alert{type="info"}
Note: set the flow `id` and `namespace` both in the resource spec and inside the flow source so updates are applied correctly.
:::

You can then use standard `kubectl` commands to create, update, list, and delete your flows:

```shell
# Create or update the flow
kubectl apply hello-world.yml

# List all flows
kubectl get flow

# Get the 'hello-world' flow
kubectl get flow hello-world

# Delete the 'hello-world' flow
kubectl delete flow hello-world
```

### Managing K/V entry resources

Here is an example key-value entry resource that you can create in a `kv-1.yml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: model.kestra.io/v1alpha1
kind: KestraKeyValue
metadata:
  name: kv-1
spec:
  namespace: company.team # This is a Kestra namespace, not a Kubernetes namespace
  key: key1
  value: value1
```

Use the same `kubectl` workflow to create, update, list, and delete your entries:

```shell
# Create or update the k/v entry
kubectl apply kv-1.yml

# List all entries
kubectl get kv

# Get the 'kv-1' k/v entries
kubectl get kv kv-1

# Delete the 'kv-1' k/v entry
kubectl delete kv kv-1
```

### Managing Namespace File resources

Here is an example namespace file resource that you can create in an `nsfile-1.yml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: model.kestra.io/v1alpha1
kind: KestraNamespaceFile
metadata:
  name: nsfile-1
spec:
  namespace: company.team # This is a Kestra namespace, not a Kubernetes namespace
  filename: nsfile-1.txt
  content: Hello World
```


You can then use the standard `kubectl` commands to create, update, list and delete your namespace files:

```shell
# Create or update the namespace file
kubectl apply nsfile-1.yml

# List all namespace files
kubectl get nsfile

# Get the 'nsfile-1' namespace file
kubectl get nsfile nsfile-1

# Delete the 'nsfile-1' namespace file
kubectl delete nsfile nsfile-1
```
