Best practices for handling flow outputs incl. purging large outputs and conditionally returning outputs.

## Conditionally returning outputs

When you have a flow that can return different outputs based on some condition, you can use a Pebble expression in the `outputs` section to conditionally return the output of task `A` if it wasn't skipped, and the output of task `B` otherwise.

```yaml
id: conditionallyReturnOutputs
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: runTask
    type: BOOLEAN
    defaults: true

tasks:
  - id: taskA
    runIf: "{{ inputs.runTask }}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: Hello World!

  - id: taskB
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: Fallback output

outputs:
  - id: flowOutput
    type: STRING
    value: "{{ tasks.taskA.state != 'SKIPPED' ? outputs.taskA.value : outputs.taskB.value }}"
```

## Purging large outputs

When you have a flow that generates large outputs that don't need to be kept after the execution is completed, you can use the `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeExecutionFiles` task to purge the outputs of the current execution.

In the example below, the flow downloads a large file from an HTTP API and uploads it to an S3 bucket. After the file is uploaded to S3, it's no longer needed, so the `PurgeExecutionFiles` task is used to delete the file from the internal storage.

```yaml
id: extractLoadPurge
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv

  - id: load
    type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.s3.Upload
    from: "{{ outputs.extractLargeFile.uri }}"
    bucket: myBucket
    key: largeFiles/orders.csv

  - id: purge
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeCurrentExecutionFiles
```
