In addition to the publicly available [Community Blueprints](../../06.concepts/07.blueprints.md), Kestra allows you to create **Custom Blueprints**—private, reusable workflow templates tailored to your team. These blueprints help centralize orchestration patterns, document best practices, and streamline collaboration across your organization.

You can think of Custom Blueprints as your team's internal App Store, offering a wide range of integrations and validated workflow patterns tailored to your needs.

### How to create a new custom blueprint

From the left navigation menu, go to **Blueprints**. Then, select the **Custom Blueprints** tab. Click on **Create**.

Add a title, description, and the contents of the flow. You can add as many tags as you want. Then click on the **Create** button.

You can edit Blueprints at any time, for example, to add new tasks or expand the documentation.

### Benefits of custom blueprints

Custom Blueprints promote code reusability and facilitate collaboration within a team. Sharing team orchestration code and documentation is now built into Kestra.

Once you reach a certain scale with many internal Blueprints, the search and filtering by tags ensures that your Blueprints remain easy to find.
