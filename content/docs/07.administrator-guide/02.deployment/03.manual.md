title: Manual deployment
---

If you want to deploy Kestra on yourself (within your own environment), we provide a standalone JAR that allows deployment on any environment you have (with an installed JVM).

The latest JAR can be downloaded [here](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable JAR:
- For Linux & MacOs, run it with `./kestra-VERSION <command>`.
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat`, and run it from `CMD`.

For example, to launch Kestra in standalone mode you will run `./kestra-VERSION server standalone`.

More information on Kestra commands can be found in [Kestra servers](../../07.administrator-guide/04.servers.md) documentation.

## Configuration

You must [configure](../../07.administrator-guide/01.configuration/index.md) Kestra inside the default `~/.kestra/config.yml` YAML file or use the `-c` or `--config` option to point to another file.
