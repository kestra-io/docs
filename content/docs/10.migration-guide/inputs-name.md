title: Inputs Name
icon: /docs/icons/migrations.svg
release: 0.15.0
---

The `name` property of `inputs` are deprecated in favor of `id` for consistency with the rest of the flow configuration.

Note that the change has been implemented in a non-breaking way, so you don't need to immediately change your existing flows in order to successfully migrate to 0.15.0. However, we recommend using the `id` property at least for new flows. The `name` property will be removed in the future.

::alert{type="info"}
All you need to do is to rename the `name` to `id` in your flow configuration â€” no other changes are required.

## Before Kestra 0.15.0

To make the change clear, here is how inputs were defined before Kestra 0.15.0:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: dev
inputs:
  - name: beverage
    type: STRING
    defaults: coffee
  - name: quantity
    type: INTEGER
    defaults: 1
```

## After Kestra 0.15.0

Here is how inputs are defined after Kestra 0.15.0:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: dev
inputs:
  - id: beverage
    type: STRING
    defaults: coffee
  - id: quantity
    type: INTEGER
    defaults: 1
```
