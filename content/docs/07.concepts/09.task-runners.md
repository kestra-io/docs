## What are script tasks?

Script tasks are built on top of the [Script Plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-scripts). They are used to run commands or execute a script. The subplugins that depend on the script plugin include:
- [Python](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-python)
- [Node](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-node)
- [Shell](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-shell)
- [PowerShell](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-powershell)
- [R](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-r)
- [Julia](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-julia)
- [Ruby](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-ruby)
- [dbt](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-dbt)
- [Singer](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-singer)
- [SQLMesh](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-sqlmesh)
- [Ansible](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-ansible)
- [Terraform](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-terraform)
- [Modal](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-modal)
- [AWS CLI](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.aws.cli.awscli)
- [GCloud CLI](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-gcp/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.cli.gcloudcli)
- [Azure CLI](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-azure/tasks/cli/io.kestra.plugin.azure.cli.azcli)

Anytime you see a task that can execute a script or a series of commands, it's a script task.

## Task runners before Kestra 0.16.0

Until Kestra 0.15.x, you could configure the script tasks to run in local **processes** or in **Docker containers** by using the `runner` property.

::collapse{title="Here is an example of a script task running in a Docker container with the DOCKER runner"}

```yaml
id: python_in_container
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: working_directory
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: clone_repository
        type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/scripts
        branch: main

      - id: get_users
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
        runner: DOCKER # ✅ This is the runner property
        docker:
          image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
        warningOnStdErr: false
        commands:
          - python etl/get_users_from_api.py

## Task runners in Kestra 0.16.0 and beyond

Kestra 0.16.0 introduces a new `taskRunner` property that provides more flexibility than the existing `runner` property and allows you to run your your code in different remote environments, including Kubernetes, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, Google Batch, and more. Since each `taskRunner` type is a plugin, you can create your own runner plugins (e.g. for Google CloudRun) and if you'd like, you can contribute them to kestra.

We envision task runners as a pluggable system allowing you to **run any code anywhere** without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## The motivation behind the `taskRunner`

The main limitation of the `runner` property is that it's a single ENUM-type property. This means that all runner-specific properties (such as the amount of CPU and memory a container can use) would need to be included directly within the `plugin-script` library. As you can imagine, this makes it difficult to manage and contribute new runners in the future:
- Which properties are generic script-task properties and which are runner-specific?
- Which properties belong to which runners?
- Why do I need to have Azure and Google SDK dependencies baked into the script plugin when I only use AWS?

Including everything in the `plugin-script` library would create a strong coupling between the script tasks and the runners, and we want to avoid that. Therefore, we've introduced the `taskRunner`, which allows you to specify the runner type and its properties in a flexible way.

Keep in mind that scrip runners are currently in Beta.

## The benefits of the `taskRunner`

### Centralized configuration management

Task runners make it easy to centrally govern your configuration. For example, since the logic for deploying a container to AWS Batch is included in the [AWS plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws) rather than in the `plugin-script` library, you can leverage `taskDefaults` on a namespace level to centrally manage your AWS credentials:

```yaml
taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.aws
    values:
      accessKeyId: "{{ secret('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}"
      secretKeyId: "{{ secret('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}"
      region: "us-east-1"
```

This configuration will apply to all tasks, triggers and runners from the `io.kestra.plugin.aws` plugin, including the `io.kestra.plugin.aws.runner.AwsBatchTaskRunner`.

### Documentation and autocompletion

Each task runner is a plugin with its own icon, documentation, and schema to validate its properties. The built-in code editor provides autocompletion and syntax validation for all runner properties, and when you click on the runner's name in the editor, you can see its documentation on the right side of the screen.

![docker_runner](/docs/concepts/docker_runner.png)

### Easier to build new custom runners

You can create a custom runner plugin for your specific environment, build it as a JAR file, and add that file into the `plugins` directory. Once you restart Kestra, your custom runner plugin will be available for use (without the need to rebuild the Script plugin).

If you'd like, you can contribute your custom runner plugin to the Kestra community, and we'll be happy to include it on the [plugins page](https://kestra.io/plugins).

### Moving from development to production is a breeze

Many Kestra users develop their scripts locally in Docker containers and then run the same code in a production environment as Kubernetes pods. Thanks to the `taskRunner` property, setting this up is a breeze. Below you see an example showing how you can combine `taskDefaults` with the `taskRunner` property to use Docker in the development environment (dedicated instance/tenant/namespace) and as Kubernetes pods in production — all without changing anything in the flow or script code.

Development environment:

```yaml
taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts
    values:
      taskRunner:
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner
        pullPolicy: IF_NOT_PRESENT # in dev, only pull the image when needed
        cpu:
          cpus: 1
        memory:
          memory: 512Mi
```

Production environment:

```yaml
taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts
    values:
      taskRunner:
        type: io.kestra.plugin.kubernetes.runner.KubernetesTaskRunner
        namespace: default
        pullPolicy: ALWAYS # Always pull the latest image in production
        config:
          username: docker-desktop
          masterUrl: https://docker-for-desktop:6443
          caCert: xxx
          clientCert: xxx
          clientKey: xxx
        resources:
          request: # The resources the container is guaranteed to get
            cpu: "500m" # Request 1/2 of a CPU (500 milliCPU)
            memory: "256Mi" # Request 256 MB of memory
```

::alert{type="info"}
Note how the `containerImage` property is not included in the `taskRunner` configuration, but as a generic property available to any script task. This makes the configuration more flexible as usually the image changes more often than the standard runner configuration. For instance, the dbt plugin may need a different image than the generic Python plugin, but the runner configuration can stay the same.
::

## The task runner types

Kestra Core includes the `ProcessTaskRunner` by default. Additionally, the `DockerTaskRunner` runner is included in the `plugin-script` library as Kestra runs all script tasks in Docker containers by default.

Other runners are provided by other plugins such as the AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes plugins. Each `taskRunner` is identified by its `type`.

Let's dive into each runner type and see how they work.

### ProcessTaskRunner

Here is an example of a Shell script configured with the `ProcessTaskRunner` which runs a Shell command as a child process in the Kestra host:

```yaml
id: process_script_runner
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.core.models.script.types.ProcessTaskRunner
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

The `ProcessTaskRunner` doesn’t have any additional configuration beyond the `type` property.

### DockerTaskRunner

Here is the same example using the `DockerTaskRunner` executing the commands in a Docker container:

```yaml
id: docker_script_runner
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    containerImage: centos
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
    commands:
      - echo "Hello World!"
```

Once you specify the `taskRunner` type, you get the autocompletion and validation for the runner-specific properties. In the example above, the task allocates 1 CPU to the container.

The only property required by the runner is the `containerImage` property that needs to be set on the script task. The image can be from a public or private registry. Additionally, using the `DockerTaskRunner` you can configure memory allocation, volumes, environment variables, and more. Check the [runner's documentation](https://develop.kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-python/task-runners/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner) in the built-in Editor for more details.

::alert{type="info"}
The `DockerTaskRunner` executes the script task as a container in a Docker-compatible engine. This means that you can also use it to run scripts within a Kubernetes  cluster with Docker-In-Docker (dind) or in a local Docker engine.

Also, keep in mind that if a Kestra Worker executing the script is terminated (e.g. due to a crash), the container will still run until completion. When running Kestra itself in a container with Docker-In-Docker (dind), both the worker and container will be restarted.
::


### KubernetesTaskRunner

This runner executes the tasks as Kubernetes pods.

- If your script task has `inputFiles` or `namespaceFiles` configured, an **init container** will be added to upload files into the main container.
- If your script task has `outputFiles` configured, a **sidecar container** will be added to download files from the main container.

All containers will use an in-memory `emptyDir` volume for file exchange.

If a task is resubmitted (e.g. due to a retry or a Worker crash), the new Worker will reattach to the already running (or an already finished) pod instead of starting a new one.

Here is a simple example of Shell commands executed in a Kubernetes pod:

```yaml
id: kubernetes_script_runner
namespace: myteam

description: |
  To get the kubeconfig file, run: `kubectl config view --minify --flatten`.
  Then, copy the `server`, `caCert`, `clientKey`, `clientCert`, `user`, and `namespace` values to the configuration below.
  Here is a mapping of the kubeconfig file to the KubernetesTaskRunner configuration:
  - client-key-data: clientKey
  - client-certificate-data: clientCert
  - certificate-authority-data: caCert
  - masterUrl: server
  - username: user

inputs:
  - id: file
    type: FILE

tasks:
  - id: shell
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    inputFiles:
      data.txt: "{{ inputs.file }}"
    outputFiles:
      - out.txt
    containerImage: centos
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.kubernetes.runner.KubernetesTaskRunner
    commands:
    - cp data.txt out.txt
```

And here is an example of a Python script executed in a Kubernetes pod:

```yaml
id: kubernetes_script_runner
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: send_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.kubernetes.runner.KubernetesTaskRunner
      namespace: default
      pullPolicy: Always
      config:
        username: docker-desktop
        masterUrl: https://docker-for-desktop:6443
        caCert: xxx
        clientCert: xxx
        clientKey: xxx
      resources:
        request: # The resources the container is guaranteed to get
          cpu: "500m" # Request 1/2 of a CPU (500 milliCPU)
          memory: "128Mi" # Request 128 MB of memory
    outputFiles:
      - "*.json"
    script: |
      import platform
      import socket
      import sys
      import json
      from kestra import Kestra

      print("Hello from a Kubernetes runner!")

      host = platform.node()
      py_version = platform.python_version()
      platform = platform.platform()
      os_arch = f"{sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}"


      def print_environment_info():
          print(f"Host's network name: {host}")
          print(f"Python version: {py_version}")
          print(f"Platform info: {platform}")
          print(f"OS/Arch: {os_arch}")

          env_info = {
              "host": host,
              "platform": platform,
              "os_arch": os_arch,
              "python_version": py_version,
          }
          Kestra.outputs(env_info)

          filename = "environment_info.json"
          with open(filename, "w") as json_file:
              json.dump(env_info, json_file, indent=4)


      print_environment_info()
```

### AwsBatchTaskRunner (ECS Fargate & EC2)

This runner will deploy the container for the task to a specified AWS Batch compute environment.

To launch the task on AWS Batch, there are three main concepts you need to be aware of:
1. **Compute environment** — mandatory, not created by the task. There are two types of compute environments you can use:
    - ECS Fargate or ECS EC2 (already supported)
    - EKS (not supported yet; for now, use `KubernetesTaskRunner` plugin if you want to run your tasks on AWS EKS)
2. **Job Queue** — will be created by the task if not specified. Creating a queue takes some time to set up, so be aware that this adds some latency to the script’s runtime.
3. **Job** — created by the task runner; holds information about which image, commands, and resources to run on. If you are familiar with AWS ECS, it’s the task definition for the containerized application.


To get started quickly, follow [this Terraform setup](https://github.com/kestra-io/terraform-deployments/tree/main/aws-batch) that will provision all resources you need to run containers on ECS Fargate using AWS Batch.

#### How does it work

In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the `AwsBatchTaskRunner` currently relies on [multi-containers ECS jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-container-jobs.html) and creates three containers for each job:
1. A _before_-container that uploads input files to S3.
2. The _main_ container that fetches input files into the `{{ workingDir }}` directory and runs the task.
3. An _after_-container that fetches output files redirected to the `{{ outputDir }}` to make them available from the Kestra UI for download and preview.

Since we don't know the working directory of the container in advance, we always need to explicitly define the working directory and output directory when using the AWS Batch runner, e.g. use `cat {{workingDir}}/myFile.txt` rather than `cat myFile.txt`.

#### A full flow example

```yaml
id: aws_batch_runner
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: scrape_environment_info
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.runner.AwsBatchTaskRunner
      region: eu-central-1
      accessKeyId: {{ secrets.awsAccessKey }}
      secretKeyId: {{ secrets.awsSecretKey }}
      computeEnvironmentArn: "arn:aws:batch:eu-central-1:707969873520:compute-environment/kestraFargateEnvironment"

    commands:
      - python {{workingDir}}/main.py
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    outputFiles:
      - "environment_info.json"
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        import platform
        import socket
        import sys
        import json
        from kestra import Kestra

        print("Hello from AWS Batch and kestra!")

        def print_environment_info():
            print(f"Host's network name: {platform.node()}")
            print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
            print(f"Platform information (instance type): {platform.platform()}")
            print(f"OS/Arch: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}")

            env_info = {
                "host": platform.node(),
                "platform": platform.platform(),
                "OS": sys.platform,
                "python_version": platform.python_version(),
            }
            Kestra.outputs(env_info)

            filename = '{{workingDir}}/environment_info.json'
            with open(filename, 'w') as json_file:
                json.dump(env_info, json_file, indent=4)

        print_environment_info()
```

### GcpBatchTaskRunner

This runner will deploy the container for the task to a specified Google Cloud Batch compute environment.

To launch the task on Google Cloud Batch, there are three main concepts you need to be aware of:
1. **Machine Type** — mandatory, the compute machine type on which the Batch will be deployed. If no `reservation` is specified, a new compute instance will be created for each batch which can takes some time.
2. **Reservation** — could be used to setup reservation upfront and avoid the time needed to create a new compute instance on each batch.
3. **Network Interfaces** — a batch need a network interface, it will use the `default` interface if not specified otherwise.

#### How does it work

In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the `GcpBatchTaskRunner` will mount a volume from a Storage bucket and uploads input files to the bucket before launching the container and downloads output files from the bucket after.

Since we don't know the working directory of the container in advance, we always need to explicitly define the working directory and output directory when using the GCP Batch runner, e.g. use `cat {{workingDir}}/myFile.txt` rather than `cat myFile.txt`.

#### A full flow example

```yaml
id: gcp_batch_runner
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: scrape_environment_info
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.runner.GcpBatchTaskRunner
      projectId: {{ secrets.projectId }}
      region: europe-west9
    commands:
      - python {{workingDir}}/main.py
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    outputFiles:
      - "environment_info.json"
    inputFiles:
      main.py: |
        import platform
        import socket
        import sys
        import json
        from kestra import Kestra

        print("Hello from GCP Batch and kestra!")

        def print_environment_info():
            print(f"Host's network name: {platform.node()}")
            print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
            print(f"Platform information (instance type): {platform.platform()}")
            print(f"OS/Arch: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}")

            env_info = {
                "host": platform.node(),
                "platform": platform.platform(),
                "OS": sys.platform,
                "python_version": platform.python_version(),
            }
            Kestra.outputs(env_info)

            filename = '{{workingDir}}/environment_info.json'
            with open(filename, 'w') as json_file:
                json.dump(env_info, json_file, indent=4)

        print_environment_info()
```

### AzureBatchTaskRunner

This runner will deploy the container for the task to a specified Azure Batch pool.

To launch the task on Azure Batch, there is only two main concepts you need to be aware of:
1. **Pool** — mandatory, not created by the task. This is a pool composed of nodes where your task can run on.
2. **Job** — created by the task runner; holds information about which image, commands, and resources to run on.

#### How does it work

In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the `AzureBatchTaskRunner` currently relies on [resource files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/resource-files) and [output files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchservice/task/add?view=rest-batchservice-2023-11-01&tabs=HTTP) which transits through [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs).

As with [ProcessTaskRunner](#ProcessTaskRunner) and [DockerTaskRunner](#DockerTaskRunner), you can directly reference input, namespace and output files since you're in the same working directory: `cat myFile.txt`.

#### A full flow example

        def print_environment_info():
            print(f"Host's network name: {platform.node()}")
            print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
            print(f"Platform information (instance type): {platform.platform()}")
            print(f"OS/Arch: {sys.platform}/{platform.machine()}")

            env_info = {
                "host": platform.node(),
                "platform": platform.platform(),
                "OS": sys.platform,
                "python_version": platform.python_version(),
            }
            Kestra.outputs(env_info)

            filename = 'environment_info.json'
            with open(filename, 'w') as json_file:
                json.dump(env_info, json_file, indent=4)

        print_environment_info()
```

## Next steps

The `taskRunner` property is backward compatible with the PROCESS and DOCKER `runner` property (except for the `containerImage`, which replaces the nested `docker.image` property). Flows using the `runner` property will continue working as expected. For better flexibility and future-proofing your flows, consider giving the `taskRunner` a try.
