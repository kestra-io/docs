Here, you will find the necessary information for deploying and configuring your Kestra cluster.

## Software requirements

The table below lists the software requirements for Kestra.

| Component         | Required version          | Note                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Java**          | >= 17 && < 18             | Default 17 using Eclipse Temurin |
| **MySQL**         | >=8 with exception 8.0.31 | Default 8.3.2                    |
| **PostgreSQL**    | >=14 && <= 15             | Default 15.3.2                   |

| **Elasticsearch** | >=7                       | Alternatively OpenSearch >= 2    |


## Hardware requirements

Kestra standalone server needs at least 4GiB Memory and 2vCPU to run correctly. In order to use script tasks, the server also needs to be able to run Docker-in-Docker (_this is why e.g. AWS ECR Fargate is currently not supported_).

If you need more guidance on how much memory and CPU to allocate to each architecture component, [reach out to us](https://kestra.io/demo) and we'll help you with the sizing based on your expected workload.
