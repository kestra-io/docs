title: Secret Manager configuration
---

Kestra offers integration with secret managers. Secrets will be stored directly on a secret back-end and workers will read them at runtime only (in memory only).

Secrets can be set using the user interface or via [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kestra-io/kestra/latest/docs/resources/namespace_secret).
