title: Secret Manager configuration
---

Kestra offers integration with secret managers. Secrets will be stored directly on a secret back-end and workers will read them at runtime only (in memory only).

Secrets can be set using the user interface or via [Terraform](../../../../11.terraform/resources/namespace_secret.md).
