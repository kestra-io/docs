title: Deployment on Amazon Web Services (EC2)
---

This guide provides instructions for deploying Kestra on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We’ll use EC2 with Docker to host Kestra server, a PostgreSQL RDS database and AWS S3 as storage backend.

Prerequisites:
* basic knowledge about using a command line interface
* basic knowledge about EC2, S3 and PostgreSQL.


## Step 1: Create an EC2 instance & install Docker

The very first step is to create an EC2 instance. To do so, [go to the AWS console and choose EC2](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home).
1. Give a name to your instance.
2. Choose Ubuntu as OS. 
3. Instance type: Kestra needs at least 4GiB Memory and 2vCPU to run correctly. Choosing t3-medium is a good starting point.
4. Create a key-pair to securely connect to your instance. This key is needed to connect through SSH in the following steps.
5. Create a security group that allows SSH traffic from your IP. Also allow HTTPS traffic.

You can now click on “Launch instance” and wait a few seconds for the compute to be up and running.

Then you can open a terminal on your laptop and connect to your instance through SSH: `ssh -i <your-key-pair.pem> ubuntu@<your-EC2-public-IP>`

Kestra can be run directly from the .jar binary or thanks to Docker. We’ll use docker here for quicker setup:
1. Install Docker on the EC2 instance. [You can find the last updated instruction on Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
2. [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To check your installation run `docker version` and `docker-compose version`. We’re now ready to download and run Kestra.


## Step 2: Download and Run Kestra

Now that we have docker-compose command line installed, we can download the official Kestra compose file: `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml`

Before running Kestra server, we will set up basic authentication to secure our instance. Vim into docker-compose.yml and set basic authentication to true:

```yaml
kestra:
  server:
    basic-auth:
      enabled: true
      username: admin
      password: kestra
```

Then use the following command to start Kestra server: `docker-compose up -d`

## Step 3: Allow external traffic

Kestra is now running and the Kestra server exposes traffic on the 8080 port. To be able to connect through our web browser we have to update inbound traffic rules in our EC2 security group.

To do so, go to the EC2 console, select Security Group and choose the security group attached to your EC2 instance.

Add a new inbound rule to open access to the 8080 port. 

If you want to only allow traffic coming from your IP you can set the source to your own IP. If you want to make it open to the whole Internet you can leave 0.0.0.0. Note that if you didn't set basic authentication in the previous step, everyone could access your Kestra instance without any access restriction.

You should now have access to your Kestra instance and create, edit and run Flow !


## Step 4: Use AWS RDS for proper database setup

This first installation relies on a Postgre database running alongside the Kestra server - on the EC2 instance (see the postgres service running thanks to the docker-compose).

For a production-grade installation, you would prefer to use a proper database setup. To do, so we’ll create an AWS RDS database.

**Create a AWS RDS database**

1. Go on the [RDS console](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home).
2. Create a database and choose Postgres (Kestra also supports MySQL)
3. Set a proper username and password.
4. On the connectivity configuration choose “Connect to an EC2 compute resource” and choose your EC2 instance.
5. Also select the existing DB subnet group and existing VPC security group and choose the one attached to your EC2 instance. 
5. Fine tune instance class, storage  type to avoid import AWS costs. For a first step a small Postgres instance is enough
6. Hit create and wait for completion

**Create kestra database**

Before attaching our Kestra server to our new database backend, we have to initialize the database with a base schema:
1. Connect to your EC2 instance with ssh
2. Install a PostgresSQL client: `sudo apt-get install postgresql-client`
3. Create the kestra database: `createdb -h <your-rds-url-endpoint> -U <your-username> -p 5432 kestra`

**Update Kestra configuration**

In the docker-compose configuration, edit the datasources property of the kestra service like below:

```yaml
datasources:
    postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<your-rds-url-endpoint>:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: <your-username>
    password: <your-password>
```

As we have moved to RDS service, we don't need the docker-compose postgres service anymore. You can remove it.

You can then restart the docker services with `docker compose restart`.

## Step 5: Use AWS S3 for storage

Kestra also uses by default the local file system for internal storage. To better persist executions and files we’ll set up AWS S3 as the internal storage backend.

1. Go to the S3 console and create a bucket.
2. Go to IAM and create a new User Group with AWS full access.
3. Create a new user and attach it to the user group.
4. For the new user, go to Security Credentials and create an access key. Choose “Application running on an AWS compute service” and retrieve the access and secret keys 
5. Edit Kestra storage configuration

    ```yaml
    kestra:
    storage:
        type: s3
        s3:
        accessKey: "<your-aws-access-key-id>"
        secretKey: "<your-aws-secret-access-key>"
        region: "<your-aws-region>"
        bucket: "<your-s3-bucket-name>"
    ```

6. Restart docker services

## Next steps

This guide walked you through installing Kestra on an AWS EC2 instance with RDS database and S3 storage backend.

This setup provides the easiest starting point for running Kestra in production on a single machine. For a deployment to a distributed cluster, check the [Kubernetes deployment guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/kubernetes).

Reach out via [Slack](https://kestra.io/slack) if you encounter any issues or if you have any questions regarding deploying Kestra to production.

Make sure to also check the [CI/CD guide](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/cicd) to automate your workflow deployments based on changes in Git.
