You can deploy Kestra anywhere. In general, we recommend:
- [Docker](./01.docker.md) for a local installation
- [Kubernetes](./02.kubernetes.md) for a production installation.

This section lists available deployment options, from your laptop or an on-prem server to a distributed cluster running in a public cloud. Select the option that suits your needs best.
