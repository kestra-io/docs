title: Manual deployment
---

If you want to deploy Kestra on yourself (within your own environment), we provide a standalone JAR that allows deployment on any environment you have (with an installed JVM version 17+).

The latest JAR can be downloaded [here](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable JAR:
- For Linux & MacOs, run it with `./kestra-VERSION <command>`.
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat`, and run it from `CMD`.

For example, to launch Kestra:
- in local mode (with a h2 local file database), you will run `./kestra-VERSION server local`.
- in standalone mode (you need to provide a [configurion](#configuration) with a connection to a database) , you will run `./kestra-VERSION server standalone`.

::alert{type="warning"}
Running the jar version will come without any [plugins](../../../plugins/index.md), you must install it manually with [install](../01.configuration/04.others.md#plugins-configuration) command
::


More information on Kestra commands can be found in [Kestra servers](../04.servers.md) documentation.

## Configuration

You must [configure](../01.configuration/index.md) Kestra inside the default `~/.kestra/config.yml` YAML file or use the `-c` or `--config` option to point to another file.
