title: Manual deployment
---

If you want to deploy Kestra on yourself (within your own environment), we provide a standalone JAR that allows deployment on any environment you have (with an installed JVM version 17+).

The latest JAR can be downloaded [here](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable JAR:
- For Linux & MacOs, run it with `./kestra-VERSION <command>`.
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat`, and run it from `CMD`.

For example, to launch Kestra:
- in local mode (with a h2 local file database), you will run `./kestra-VERSION server local`.
- in standalone mode (you need to provide a [configurion](#configuration) with a connection to a database) , you will run `./kestra-VERSION server standalone`.

::alert{type="warning"}
Running the jar version will come without any [plugins](../../../plugins/index.md), you must install it manually with [install](../01.configuration/04.others.md#plugins-configuration) command
::


More information on Kestra commands can be found in [Kestra servers](../04.servers.md) documentation.

## Configuration

You can either put your whole configuration in the environment variable `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` or you can specify a configuration file to read through `--config` (or `-c`) option. If neither of these option is used, Kestra will read from `${HOME}/.kestra/config.yml`.

If you are using `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable, you'll need to have a directory called `confs` in the directory where you run Kestra.

Configuration options are available [here](../01.configuration/index.md), you can also see the default configuration loaded on  [GitHub](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/cli/src/main/resources/application.yml).
