title: Kestra server command
---

Kestra leverages five different server components. The `kestra server` command allows to start them one by one, or run an all-inclusive standalone server.

## Separate server components

### [Kestra Executor](../08.architecture.md#executor)

`./kestra server executor`

**Options:**

No special options for this server.

### [Kestra Indexer](../08.architecture.md#indexer)

`./kestra server indexer`

**Options:**

No special options for this server.

### [Kestra Scheduler](../08.architecture.md#scheduler)

`./kestra server scheduler`

**Options:**

No special options for this server.

### [Kestra Worker](../08.architecture.md#worker)

`./kestra server worker`

**Options:**

* `-t` or `--thread`: the number of threads that can handle tasks at the same time. By default, the worker will start 2 threads per CPU core available.

### [Kestra Webserver](../08.architecture.md)

`./kestra server webserver`

**Options:**

No special options for this server.

## Kestra standalone, all server components in one process

`./kestra server standalone`

This server is a special server, since it will contain all the server components in one JVM.
This works well for development or small-sized environments.

**Options:**

* `-f` or `--flow-path`: the path to a directory with YAML flow files. These files will be loaded to the repository at startup.
* `--worker-thread`: the number of worker threads. By default, the embedded worker will start 3 threads or a single thread per CPU core when more than 3 CPU cores are available.

## Kestra local, development server with no dependencies

`./kestra server local`

This server is a local development server. It will contain all the servers in one JVM, and use a local database (H2), and local storage - perfect to start a development server. All the data will be saved in a `data` directory on the current working directory.

**Options:**

* `-f` or `--flow-path`: the path to a directory with YAML flow files. These files will be loaded to the repository at startup.
* `--worker-thread`: the number of worker threads. By default, the embedded worker will start 3 threads or a single thread per CPU core when more than 3 CPU cores are available.

## Options for all server commands

### Log Level

Log level can be changed with two options:

* `-l` or `--log-level`: possible values: `[TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR]`, default: `INFO`
* `-v` or `--verbose`: for `DEBUG`, `-vv` for `TRACE`

These options affect global log levels for all flows only.

### Internal Log

`--internal-log`: Kestra hides internal logs by default. Use this option to enable these logs.

::alert{type="warning"}
This option enables logs of very high verbosity.

### Configuration Files

`-c` or `--config`: You can change the location of Kestra [configuration](./01.configuration/index.md) files, the default is `~/.kestra/config.yml`.

### Plugins directory

`-p` or `--plugins`: Path to the plugins directory. The default is the `plugins` directory near your Kestra executable.

### Server port

`--port`: The server port, the default is `8080`.
