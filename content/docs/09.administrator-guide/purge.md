Purge old executions and logs to save disk space.

As your workflows grow, you may need to clean up old executions and logs to save disk space.

The recommended way to clean execution and logs is using a combination of [`io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions`](/plugins/core/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.purgeexecutions) and the newly added [`io.kestra.plugin.core.log.PurgeLogs`](/plugins/core/tasks/log/io.kestra.plugin.core.log.purgelogs) task as shown below. The `PurgeLogs` task removes all logs (both `Execution` logs and `Trigger` logs) in a performant batch operation. Combining those two together will give you the same functionality as the previous `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge` task but in a more performant and reliable way (roughly [10x faster](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/4298#issuecomment-2220106142)).

Additionally, the [Enterprise Edition](../06.enterprise/index.md) includes the [`PurgeAuditLogs` task](../06.enterprise/02.governance/06.audit-logs.md#how-to-purge-audit-logs).
::

```yaml
id: purge
namespace: company.myteam
description: |
  This flow will remove all executions and logs older than 1 month.
  We recommend running this flow daily to avoid running out of disk space.

tasks:
  - id: purge_executions
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"
    purgeLog: false

  - id: purge_logs
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.PurgeLogs
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"

triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"
```

## Purge tasks vs. UI deletion

It is important to note the difference between executing a purge task to clean your Kestra instance versus deleting items such as flows, executions, or logs in the UI. Using a purge task hard deletes those records from your Kestra instance (i.e., the deleted data is unrecoverable). This clears up disk space storage and is an effective practice to take with Kestra data that is no longer needed or stored externally. For example, you can purge any log data more than one month old on a schedule to keep your instance clean. 

Alternatively, deleting executions or logs from the UI performs a soft deletion of the data and does not fully wipe the storage as a purge task would. For example, if you delete a flow and then create a flow with the same name and `id`, then the historical data from that flow will reappear such as revision history and past executions. This data is retained because it provides a full history of the flow and its revisions for troubleshooting or auditing.   

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that the **Purge tasks** do not affect Kestra's [internal queues](../07.architecture/01.main-components.md#queue). Queue retention is configured separately. The database type uses a dedicated [JDBC Cleaner](../configuration/index.md#jdbc-cleaner) and the Kafka type relies on [topic retention](../configuration/index.md#topic-retention).

::collapse{title="Renamed Purge Tasks in 0.18.0"}
We've [improved](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/4298) the mechanism of the **Purge tasks** to make them more performant and reliable — some tasks have been renamed to reflect their enhanced functionality.

Here are the main `Purge` plugin changes in Kestra 0.18.0:

- `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge` has been renamed to `io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions` to reflect that it only purges data related to executions (_e.g. not including trigger logs — to purge those you should use the `PurgeLogs` task_) — we've added an alias so that using the old task type will still work but it will emit a warning. We recommend using the new task type.
- `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeExecution` has been renamed to `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeCurrentExecutionFiles` to reflect that it can purge all execution-related data incl. inputs to an Execution and Execution outputs — also here, we've added an alias so that using the old task type will still work but it will emit a warning. Again, we recommend adjusting your flow code to match the new task type.
