How to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository.

## Minimal configuration

In order to connect to a database, you need to configure a `datasource`. Kestra uses The [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) connection pool under the hood, and if needed, you can configure multiple options from the HikariCP documentation directly in your datasource configuration.


### PostgreSQL

Here is a minimal configuration for PostgreSQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres

datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
```

---

### MySQL

Here is a minimal configuration for MySQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql

datasources:
  mysql:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kestra
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: MYSQL
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that we currently don't support the `8.0.31` version of MySQL. If possible, try another version or reach out via [Slack](/slack) to help you troubleshoot.

### SQL Server

Here is a minimal configuration for a SQL Server database, currently available in preview in the Enterprise Edition since Kestra 0.18.0:

```yaml
kestra:
  repository:
    type: sqlserver
  queue:
    type: sqlserver

datasources:
  sqlserver:
    url: jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433
    driverClassName: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: SQL_SERVER
# Uncomment only if your database is not encrypted
#    data-source-properties:
#      encrypt: false
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that this feature is currently in preview and only available in the Enterprise Edition. If you want to try it, please [reach out](/demo) to get access.

### H2

Here is a minimal configuration for H2:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: h2
  repository:
    type: h2

datasources:
  h2:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:public;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password: ""
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
```

## Connection pool size

The total number of connections opened to the database will depend on your chosen [architecture](../07.architecture/index.md). Each Kestra instance will open a pool of up to the `maximum-pool-size` (10 by default), with a minimum size of the `minimum-idle` (also set to 10 by default).

- If you deploy Kestra as a standalone server, it will open 10 connections to the database.
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately, it will open 40 connections to the database (10 per component).
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately with 3 replicas, it will open 120 connections to the database.

Usually, the default connection pool sizing is enough, as HikariCP is optimized to use a low number of connections.

## Queues configuration

### `kestra.jdbc.queues`

Kestra database queues simulate queuing doing long polling. They query a `queues` table to detect new messages.

You can change these parameters to reduce the polling latency, but be aware it will increase the load on the database:

- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-size`: the maximum number of queues items fetched by each poll.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.min-poll-interval`: the minimum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.max-poll-interval`: the maximum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-switch-interval`: the delay for switching from min-poll-interval to max-poll-interval when no message is received. (ex: when one message is received, the `min-poll-interval` is used, if no new message arrived within `poll-switch-interval`, we switch to `max-poll-interval`).


Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      poll-size: 100
      min-poll-interval: 25ms
      max-poll-interval: 1000ms
      poll-switch-interval: 5s
```

### `kestra.jdbc.cleaner`

Kestra cleans the `queues` table periodically to optimize storage and performance. You can control how often you want this cleaning to happen, and how long messages should be kept in the `queues` table .

Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    cleaner:
      initial-delay: 1h
      fixed-delay: 1h
      retention: 7d
```

## Protecting against too big messages

::alert{type="info"}
Note: this is an experimental feature available starting with Kestra 0.19.
::

The database backend has no limit on the size of messages it can handle. However, as messages are loaded into memory, this can endanger Kestra itself and push pressure on memory usage.

To prevent that, you can configure a functionality that will refuse to store too big messages and fail the execution instead.

The following configuration will refuse messages that exceed 1MiB by failing the execution.

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      message-protection:
        enabled: true
        limit: 1048576
```
