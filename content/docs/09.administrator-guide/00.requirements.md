## Hardware requirements

Kestra standalone server needs at least 4GiB of memory and 2vCPU to run correctly. In order to use script tasks, the server also needs to be able to run Docker-in-Docker (_this is why e.g. AWS ECR Fargate is currently not supported_).

If you need more guidance on how much memory and CPU to allocate to each architecture component, [reach out to us](/demo) and we'll help you with the sizing based on your expected workload.
