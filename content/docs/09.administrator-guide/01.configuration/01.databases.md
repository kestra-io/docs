title: Database configuration
---

First, you need to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository, for example for PostgreSQL:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres
```

Currently, Kestra supports three databases: H2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. H2 can be convenient for local development, but MySQL or PostgreSQL must be used in production.

::alert{type="warning"}
The minimum version for PostgreSQL is 14.
::

::alert{type="info"}
If you experience performance issues when using PostgreSQL, you can tune the cost optimizer parameter `random_page_cost=1.1`, which should make PostgreSQL use the right index for the queues table. You can also configure `kestra.queue.postgres.disable-seq-scan=true` so that Kestra turns off sequential scans on the queue polling query forcing PostgreSQL to use the index.

## Minimal configuration

The most important thing is to configure the way Kestra connects to a database, what is called a datasource. Under the cover, Kestra uses The [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) connection pool ; each configuration options described inside the HikariCP documentation can be configured.

Here is a minimal configuration for PostgreSQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres

datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
```

Here is a minimal configuration for MySQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql

datasources:
  mysql:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kestra
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: MYSQL
```

Here is a minimal configuration for H2:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: h2
  repository:
    type: h2

datasources:
  h2:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:public;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password: ""
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
```

## Connection pool size

The total number of connections opened to the database will depend on the [deployment architecture](../../08.architecture.md#deployment-architecture) used. Each Kestra instance will open a pool of up to the `maximum-pool-size` setting of 10 by default, with a minimum size of the `minimum-idle`  setting of 10 by default.

For example:
- If you deploy Kestra as a standalone server, it will open 10 connections to the database.
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately, it will open 40 connections to the database (10 per component).
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately with 3 replicas, it will open 120 connections to the database.

Usually, the default connection pool sizing is enough, as HikariCP is optimized to use a low number of connections.

```

## Queues configuration

### `kestra.jdbc.queues`

Kestra database queues simulate queuing doing long polling. They query a `queues` table to detect new messages.

You can change these parameters to reduce the polling latency, but be aware it will increase the load on the database:

- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-size`: the maximum number of queues items fetched by each poll.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.min-poll-interval`: the minimum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.max-poll-interval`: the maximum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-switch-interval`: the delay for switching from min-poll-interval to max-poll-interval when no message is received. (ex: when one message is received, the `min-poll-interval` is used, if no new message arrived within `poll-switch-interval`, we switch to `max-poll-interval`).


Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      poll-size: 100
      min-poll-interval: 25ms
      max-poll-interval: 1000ms
      poll-switch-interval: 5s

```

### `kestra.jdbc.cleaner`

Kestra cleans the `queues` table periodically to avoid infinite growth.
You can control how often you want this cleaning to happen, and how long messages should be kept in the `queues` table .

Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    cleaner:
      initial-delay: 1h
      fixed-delay: 1h
      retention: 7d
```

## Database migrations

### Automatic database migration

Kestra uses [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to automatically perform database migrations when Kestra server is started. Flyway is a tool that allows version controlling changes to a database (such as Kestra's database) so that you can migrate it to a new version easily. Kestra stores the current version of the database in a table called `flyway_schema_history`. When Flyway runs, it compares the current version of the database with the version that it should be at. If the versions do not match, Flyway will run the necessary migrations to bring the database up to date. This process is automatic when Kestra server starts, therefore no manual intervention is required.

### Manual database migration

Sometimes a manual database migration is useful, especially when you have a large database and you want to perform the migration before upgrading Kestra to avoid a long downtime.

For example, when migrating from kestra v0.12.0 to v0.13.0, all indexes will be rebuilt due to addition of the multi-tenancy feature (the `tenant_id` column is added on almost every table). When using the JDBC runner with a large database, database migration can take multiple hours. In such use cases, we recommend performing the migration manually before starting Kestra by using the `kestra sys database migrate` command.

This command should use the same configuration as configured on your Kestra instance. Depending on whether you deploy Kestra using Docker or Kubernetes, this command can be launched via a `docker exec` or a `kubectl exec` command.

There are two ways to initiate the manual database migration:
1. Keep Kestra running in an old version. Then, stop Kestra and launch the command on the new version.
2. Start Kestra on the new version with automatic schema migration disabled via `flyway.datasources.postgres.enabled=false` and launch the command: `kestra sys database migrate`.


Here is an example of how to launch the command via a `docker exec` command:

```bash
docker exec your_container_id bash ./kestra sys database migrate --help
```

Here is the output of that `--help` command:

```bash
Usage: kestra sys database migrate [-hVv] [--internal-log] [-c=<config>]
                                   [-l=<logLevel>] [-p=<pluginsPath>]
Force database schema migration.
Kestra uses Flyway to manage database schema evolution, this command will run
Flyway then exit.
  -c, --config=<config>   Path to a configuration file, default: /root/.
                            kestra/config.yml)
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
      --internal-log      Change also log level for internal log, default:
                            false)
  -l, --log-level=<logLevel>
                          Change log level (values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
                            ERROR; default: INFO)
  -p, --plugins=<pluginsPath>
                          Path to plugins directory , default: ./plugins)
  -v, --verbose           Change log level. Multiple -v options increase the
                            verbosity.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
```
