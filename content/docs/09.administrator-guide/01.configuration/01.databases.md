title: Database configuration
---

First, you need to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository, for example for MySQL:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql
```

Currently, Kestra supports three databases: H2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. H2 can be convenient for local development, but MySQL or PostgreSQL must be used in production.

## Minimal configuration
The most important thing is to configure the way Kestra connects to a database, what is called a datasource.


Here is a minimal configuration for MySQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql

datasources:
  mysql:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kestra
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: MYSQL
```


Here is a minimal configuration for PostgreSQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres

datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
```


Here is a minimal configuration for H2:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: h2
  repository:
    type: h2

datasources:
  h2:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:public;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password: ""
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
```


## Datasource properties

Since Kestra is built with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP), many configuration options are available to configure the datasource and the connection pool:

## Queues configuration

### `kestra.jdbc.queues`

Kestra database queues simulate queuing doing long polling. They query a `queues` table to detect new messages.

You can change these parameters to reduce the polling latency, but be aware it will increase the load on the database:

- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-size`: the maximum number of queues items fetched by each poll.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.min-poll-interval`: the minimum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.max-poll-interval`: the maximum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-switch-interval`: the delay for switching from min-poll-interval to max-poll-interval when no message is received. (ex: when one message is received, the `min-poll-interval` is used, if no new message arrived within `poll-switch-interval`, we switch to `max-poll-interval`).


Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      poll-size: 100
      min-poll-interval: 25ms
      max-poll-interval: 1000ms
      poll-switch-interval: 5s

```

### `kestra.jdbc.cleaner`

Kestra cleans the `queues` table periodically to avoid infinite growth.
You can control how often you want this cleaning to happen, and how long messages should be kept in the `queues` table .

Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    cleaner:
      initial-delay: 1h
      fixed-delay: 1h
      retention: 7d
```
