Run R code directly inside of your Flows and generate outputs.

R is essential for statistical analysis, visualization, and data manipulation. With Kestra, you can effortlessly automate data ingestion, conduct complex statistical analysis, and handle real-time data processing. Kestra's robust orchestration capabilities ensure that your R scripts run smoothly and efficiently, streamlining your data-driven projects.

This guide is going to walk you through how to get R running inside of a workflow, how to manage input and output files, and how you can pass outputs and metrics back to Kestra to use in later tasks.

## Executing R inside Kestra

Kestra has an official plugin for R allowing you to execute R code inside of a flow by either writing your R code inline or by executing an `.R` file. You can get outputs and metrics from your R code too.

### Scripts

If you want to write a short amount of R code to perform a task, you can use the `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script` type to write it directly inside of your flow. This allows you to keep everything in one place.

```yaml
id: r_script
namespace: company.team
description: This flow runs the R script.

tasks:
  - id: http_download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv

  - id: r_script_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
    script: |
      print("The current execution is {{ execution.id }}")

      # Read the file downloaded in `http_download` task
      data <- read.csv("{{ outputs.http_download.uri }}", header=TRUE)
      print(data)
```

You can read more about the Scripts type in the [Plugin documentation](/plugins/plugin-script-r/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.script)

### Commands

If you would prefer to put your R code in an `.R` file (e.g. your code is much longer or spread across multiple files), you can run the previous example using the `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Commands` type:

```yaml
id: r_commands
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: run_r
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    commands:
      - Rscript main.R
```

The contents of the `main.R` file can be:

```r
print("Hello World")
```

You'll need to add your R code using the Editor or [sync it using Git](../08.developer-guide/04.git.md) so Kestra can see it. You'll also need to set the `enabled` flag for the `namespaceFiles` property to `true` so Kestra can access the file.

You can also have the R code written inline.

```yaml
id: r_commands
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: http_download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv

  - id: run_r
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Commands
    inputFiles:
      orders.csv: "{{ read(outputs.http_download.uri) }}"
      main.R: |
        print("The current execution is {{ execution.id }}")

        # Read the file
        data <- read.csv("orders.csv", header=TRUE)
        print(data)
    commands:
      - Rscript main.R
```

You can read more about the Commands type in the [Plugin documentation](/plugins/plugin-script-r/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.commands).

## Handling Outputs

If you want to get a variable or file from your R script, you can use an [output](../04.workflow-components/06.outputs.md).

### Variable Output

You can get the JSON outputs from the R commands / script using the `::{}::` pattern. Here is an example:

```yaml
id: r_outputs
namespace: company.team
description: This flow runs the R script, and outputs the variable.

tasks:
  - id: r_outputs_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
    script: |
      cat('::{"outputs":{"test":"value","int":2,"bool":true,"float":3.65}}::')
```

All the output variables can be viewed in the Outputs tab of the execution.

![r_outputs](/docs/how-to-guides/r/outputs.png)

You can refer to the outputs in another task as shown in the example below:

```yaml
id: r_outputs
namespace: company.team
description: This flow runs the R script, and outputs the variable.

tasks:
  - id: r_outputs_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
    script: |
      cat('::{"outputs":{"test":"value","int":2,"bool":true,"float":3.65}}::')

  - id: return
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: '{{ outputs.r_outputs_task.vars.test }}'
```

_This example works for both `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script` and `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Commands`._

### File Output

Inside of your R script, write a file to the system. You'll need to add the `outputFiles` property to your flow and list the files you're trying to put out. In this case, we want to output `output.txt`. More information on the formats you can use for this property can be found [here](../08.developer-guide/07.scripts/07.outputs-metrics.md).

The example below writes a `output.txt` file containing the "Hello World" text. We can then refer the file using the syntax `{{ outputs.{task_id}.outputFiles['<filename>'] }}`, and read the contents of the file using the `read()` function.

```yaml
id: r_output_file
namespace: company.team
description: This flow runs the R script to output a file.

tasks:
  - id: r_outputs_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
    outputFiles:
      - output.txt
    script: |
      writeLines("Hello World", "output.txt")

  - id: log_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ read(outputs.r_outputs_task.outputFiles['output.txt']) }}"
```

_This example works for both `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script` and `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Commands`._

## Handling Metrics

You can also get [metrics](../08.developer-guide/07.scripts/06.outputs-metrics.md#outputs-and-metrics-in-script-and-commands-tasks) from your R script. We use the same pattern for defining metrics as we had used for outputs `::{}::`. In this example, we will demonstrate both the counter and timer metrics.

```yaml
id: r_metrics
namespace: company.team
description: This flow runs the R script, and puts out the metrics.

tasks:
  - id: r_metrics_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
    script: |
      print('There are 20 products in the cart')
      cat('::{"outputs":{"productCount":20}}::\n')
      cat('::{"metrics":[{"name":"productCount","type":"counter","value":20}]}::\n')
      cat('::{"metrics":[{"name":"purchaseTime","type":"timer","value":32.44}]}::\n')
```

Once this has executed, both the metrics can be viewed under **Metrics**.
