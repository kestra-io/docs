Kestra is built with an API-first design in mind, with a powerful API allowing you to connect Kestra to external systems. Whether that's through your flows directly or using the Kestra API, there's lots of options.

In this guide, we're going to specifically look at the Kestra API and how that can enable you to extend Kestra and integrate it into other systems.

## Using the API Reference

In the documentation, there's references for both the [Open Source](../api-reference/open-source.md) as well as [Cloud & Enterprise ](../api-reference/enterprise.md) APIs to make it easy to know what you can do with them. We're going to look at a number examples we can create with both references. When we open the [Open Source API Reference](../api-reference/open-source.md), we can see there's a number of sections to make it easy to navigate:

![api_reference](/docs/how-to-guides/api/api_reference.png)

## Making Requests with Authentication

If you have [Basic Auth enabled](../configuration/index.md#http-basic-authentication), or you're using the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise), you will need to add authentication to your requests. You can easily do this using the `-u` argument and passing our username and password in using the following format `username:password`. This example uses the default username and password inside of the [Kestra Docker Compose](../02.installation/03.docker-compose.md):

```bash
curl -X POST -u 'admin@kestra.io:kestra' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/company.team/hello_world
```

With the Enterprise Edition, you can generate [API Tokens](../06.enterprise/api-tokens.md) to authenticate when making requests, for example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/company.team/hello_world \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

For the examples below, we will not have authentication enabled.

## Create a Flow

To create a flow using the API, we can first go to the Flows section of the API Reference and see the `/api/v1/flows` [POST Request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#post-/api/v1/flows) which takes a YAML body with the Flow in it.

Our body of Content-Type `application/x-yaml` will look like the example below:
```yaml
id: created_by_api
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World! ðŸš€
```

To make this request, we can use [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) in the command line:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows -H "Content-Type:application/x-yaml" -d "id: created_by_api
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World! ðŸš€"
```

When we make this request, we will get a response like below:

```json
{
  "id": "created_by_api",
  "namespace": "company.team",
  "revision": 1,
  "disabled": false,
  "deleted": false,
  "tasks":
    [
      {
        "id": "hello",
        "type": "io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log",
        "message": "Hello World! \uD83D\uDE80",
      },
    ],
  "source": "id: created_by_api\nnamespace: company.team\n\ntasks:\n  - id: hello\n    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log\n    message: Hello World! \uD83D\uDE80",
}
```

## Execute a Flow

To execute a flow, we need the namespace and flow ID. We have an example flow called `hello_world` in the `company.team` namespace with one string input:

```yaml
id: hello_world
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: greeting
    type: STRING
    defaults: hey

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ inputs.greeting }}"
```

As our input has a default value, we can execute it by simply making a [POST request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#post-/api/v1/executions/-namespace-/-id-) `/api/v1/executions/{namespace}/{id}` like below:

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/company.team/hello_world
```

If we want to add an input as part of our request, we can add it as part of our form data with `-F`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/company.team/hello_world \
-F greeting="hey there"
```

When we do this, it will return the following response:

```json
{
    "id": "MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR",
    "namespace": "company.team",
    "flowId": "hello_world",
    "flowRevision": 10,
    "inputs": {
        "greeting": "hey"
    },
    "labels": [
        {
            "key": "system.correlationId",
            "value": "MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR"
        }
    ],
    "state": {
        "current": "CREATED",
        "histories": [
            {
                "state": "CREATED",
                "date": "2024-11-21T16:31:27.943162175Z"
            }
        ],
        "duration": 0.044177500,
        "startDate": "2024-11-21T16:31:27.943162175Z"
    },
    "originalId": "MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR",
    "deleted": false,
    "metadata": {
        "attemptNumber": 1,
        "originalCreatedDate": "2024-11-21T16:31:27.943194342Z"
    },
    "url": "http://localhost:8080//ui/executions/company.team/hello_world/MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR"
}
```

For more examples on executing with the API, check out the [Executions documentation](../04.workflow-components/03.execution.md#execute-a-flow-via-an-api-call)

## Get Information from an Execution

When we execute a flow with the API, our response includes the Execution ID from that execution. This means we can use this to fetch more information about the Execution, especially once it's completed. In the previous example, the execution ID generated was `MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR` so let's use that to get an updated status on the execution with the [GET Request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#get-/api/v1/executions/-executionId-) `/api/v1/executions/{executionId}`:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/MYkTmLrI36s10iVXHwRbR
```

The response received includes everything about the execution including the times the state changed, and any outputs generated:

We can modify our flow to generate an output like so:

```yaml
id: hello_world
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "This is an output"

```

When we fetch the data from an Execution of this flow with Execution ID `59uQXHbkMy5YwHEDom72Xv`, we get the following response:

## Accessing the KV Store

Kestra has a [KV Store](../05.concepts/05.kv-store.md) which is useful for making your flows stateful. We can fetch, modify and delete data in the KV Store using the API. This can be useful if you want to modify the KV Store directly inside of your code being executed by Kestra, or by an external system.

To start with, we can add a KV pair to the KV Store with the following [PUT request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#put-/api/v1/namespaces/-namespace-/kv/-key-) `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/kv/{key}`. In this example, we're going to add a `my_key` key with the value set to `"Hello, World"` into the `company.team` namespace.

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/kv/my_key -d '"Hello, World"'
```
We can check in Kestra that it was added successfully:
![kv_api](/docs/how-to-guides/api/kv_api.png)

We can modify this by changing the body. For example, we will change the body to `"This is a modified value"`:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/kv/my_key -d '"This is a modified value"'
```

We can see the key has been modified since it was created:

![modified_kv](/docs/how-to-guides/api/modified_kv.png)

When we open the key, we will see the value has also been modified to reflect our request.

![modified_value_kv](/docs/how-to-guides/api/modified_value_kv.png)

If we want to fetch the value from the KV Store, we will do so with the following [GET Request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#get-/api/v1/namespaces/-namespace-/kv/-key-) `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespaces}/kv/{key}`. In this example, we can fetch the latest value from the key `my_key`:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/kv/my_key
```

It returns the response containing the pair:

```json
{
    "type": "STRING",
    "value": "This is a modified value"
}
```

You can read more about using the KV Store with the API in the [KV Store documentation](../05.concepts/05.kv-store.md#api-how-to-create-read-update-and-delete-kv-pairs-via-rest-api)

## Get and Upload Namespaces Files

Along with managing your Flows with the API, you can also manage your Namespace Files.

Using the [GET Request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#get-/api/v1/namespaces/-namespace-/files/directory) `/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/files/directory`, we can get a list of all the files in our namespace.

We will make this request for the `company.team` namespace with the following command:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/files/directory
```

Our response contains an array containing information about the files:

```json
[
    {
        "type": "File",
        "size": 13,
        "fileName": "example.txt",
        "lastModifiedTime": 1731430406183,
        "creationTime": 1731430400773
    },
    {
        "type": "File",
        "size": 27,
        "fileName": "example.js",
        "lastModifiedTime": 1731415024668,
        "creationTime": 1730997234841
    },
    {
        "type": "File",
        "size": 19,
        "fileName": "example.sh",
        "lastModifiedTime": 1731415024667,
        "creationTime": 1730997234839
    },
    {
        "type": "File",
        "size": 171,
        "fileName": "example.ion",
        "lastModifiedTime": 1731430044778,
        "creationTime": 1731430012804
    },
    {
        "type": "File",
        "size": 21,
        "fileName": "example.py",
        "lastModifiedTime": 1731415024667,
        "creationTime": 1729781670534
    }
]
```

With this information, we can make a request to get the content of a specific file using a [GET request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#get-/api/v1/namespaces/-namespace-/files) `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/files`.

We will make the following request to fetch the content of `example.txt`:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/files?path=example.txt'
```

which returns:

```
Hello, World!
```

We can also upload files using a [POST request](https://kestra.io/docs/api-reference/open-source#post-/api/v1/namespaces/-namespace-/files) `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/files`. In this example, we will upload a Python file called `api_example.py` with the following content:

```python
import requests

r = requests.get("https://kestra.io")
print({r.status_code})
```

To do this, we will make the following request:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/company.team/files?path=api_example.py' -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" -F "fileContent=@api_example.py"
```

::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** Make sure `fileContent` has the correct path to your file.

When we make this request, we can see it appear in the Namespace Editor:
