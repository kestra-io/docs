# Monitoring with Prometheus and Triggering Flows in Kestra

This guide explains how to connect Prometheus to Kestra and configure a workflow that is triggered by Prometheus alerts. This guide covers the basics and is intended as a starting off point for any production workflows. You will:

1. Integrate Prometheus with Kestra
2. Configure Prometheus Alertmanager to send alerts via webhook
3. Use a Webhook Trigger in a Kestra flow

---

## Connect Prometheus to Kestra

Kestra natively supports integration with Prometheus for metric scraping and visualization. Kestra exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at port 8081 on the endpoint `/prometheus`. This endpoint can be used by any compatible monitoring system.

Follow these steps based on the [Kestra Monitoring Guide](./monitoring.md).

Once Kestra is up and running, you can check out the available metrics by going to `http://localhost:8081/prometheus` on your browser.

## Configure Prometheus to Scrape Kestra

Add the Kestra metrics endpoint to your Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    metrics_path: /prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<kestra-host-ip-address>:8081"]
```

Be sure to put the appropriate <kestra-host-ip-address> in the last line, e.g., `localhost:8081` or `host.docker.internal:8081`. Restart Prometheus for the changes to take effect.

::alert{type="info"}
If you're running everything with Docker on the same machine, you will need to change your host address to `host.docker.internal` rather than localhost, or the name of the container.

## Create a Prometheus Alert and Webhook Receiver

To trigger a Kestra flow on a Prometheus alert, we need to configure [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) to send a webhook to Kestra. You can [download Alertmanager and Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) from the official site as well as run the services in a Docker Compose file, refer below for an example:

```yaml
services:
    prometheus:
        image: prom/prometheus
        privileged: true
        volumes:
            - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
            - ./alertmanager/alert.rules:/alertmanager/alert.rules
        command:
            - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
        ports:
            - '9090:9090'

    node-exporter:
        image: prom/node-exporter
        ports:
            - '9100:9100'

    alertmanager:
        image: prom/alertmanager
        privileged: true
        volumes:
             - ./alertmanager/alertmanager.yml:/alertmanager.yml
        command:
            - '--config.file=/alertmanager.yml'
        ports:
            - '9093:9093'
```

You can verify Prometheus is up and running by going to `http://localhost:9090/graph` and visualizing some metrics using the PromQL. Below is one of the graphs for `kestra_executor_execution_started_count_total` metric:

![Prometheus metric graph](/docs/how-to-guides/setup-monitoring/promql_graph.png)

Similarly, you can go to `http://localhost:9093/status` and see that the Alertmanager is ready.

![Alertmanager Status](/docs/how-to-guides/alertmanager-status.png)

### Step 1: Define a Prometheus Alert

In your `prometheus.yml` file, you must add Alertmanager and some rules files. For example, the `prometheus.yml` configuration now looks as follows:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    metrics_path: /prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<kestra-host-ip-address>:8081"]

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - 'localhost: 9093' # Replace with your host name (i.e., host.docker.internal)

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
    - "/alertmanager/alert.rules"
```

Create a simple rule to alert on high CPU usage or another metric exposed by Kestra. Refer to our full list at [Kestra Prometheus Metrics](../09.administrator-guide/prometheus-metrics.md):

```yaml
groups:
  - name: alert.rules
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: system_cpu_usage == 1.0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: "critical"
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
```

You can also use a simple, generic instance down alert such as:

```yaml
groups:
- name: alert.rules
  rules:
  # Alert for any instance that is unreachable for >5 minutes.
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 5m
```

Test different metrics and statuses for what fits your use case. Save these rules in a file such as `alert.rules.yml` and configure Prometheus to load it like in the above `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
rule_files:
    - "/alertmanager/alert.rules"
```

::alert{type="info"}
Make sure that your `groups.name` and `rule_files` have the same name so that Alertmanager correctly connects the alerts.
::

To check that your rules are picked up by Prometheus, go to `http://localhost:9090/rules`.

![Prometheus Rules](/docs/how-to-guides/alert-rules.png)

From there, you can see a list of the rules set in the `alert.rules.yml` file:

![Prometheus Rules List](/docs/how-to-guides/alert-rules-list.png)

### Step 2: Configure Alertmanager to Use a Webhook

Now that all the services are connected, edit `alertmanager.yml` to send alerts to a Kestra webhook:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'kestra-webhook'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'https://<your-kestra-host>/api/v1/triggers/webhook'
        send_resolved: true

route:
  receiver: 'kestra-webhook'
```

Ensure your Alertmanager is restarted and using this configuration.

## 3. Create a Kestra Webhook Triggered Flow

Now create a Kestra flow that is triggered by a Prometheus alert via [webhook](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/03.webhook-trigger.md) from the rule definitions specified in the `alert.rules.yml` file.

### Example Flow Definition

```yaml
id: prometheus-alert
namespace: system

triggers:
  - id: from-prometheus
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Webhook
    key: prometheus

tasks:
  - id: log-alert
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Received alert: {{ trigger.body }}"
```

Once the flow is written, you can verify the trigger is active from the **Flows -> Triggers** tab in the UI.

![Prometheus Webhook Trigger](/docs/how-to-guides/prometheus-webhook-trigger.png)

### How It Works

* The `Webhook` trigger listens for HTTP POST requests to:

  ```
  https://<your-kestra-host>/api/v1/triggers/webhook/prometheus
  ```
- Prometheus Alertmanager sends alerts to this endpoint.
- The flow is executed with the alert content available as `{{ trigger.body }}`.
