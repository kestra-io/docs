How to migrate from `runner` to `taskRunner`.

## Why the change?

Task Runners is a pluggable system that allows you to offload the execution of your tasks to different environments.

With the general availability of `taskRunner` in Kestra 0.18.0, the [runner](/docs/08.developer-guide/07.scripts/03.runners.md) property is deprecated. Task Runners provide more flexibility and control over how your tasks are executed, allowing you to run your code in various remote environments by:
1. Leveraging task runner plugins [managed by Kestra](/demo/)
2. Building your own task runner plugins customized to your needs.

## Migration

To migrate from the `runner` property to `taskRunner`, update your flow code as follows:

1. Replace the `runner` property with `taskRunner`.
2. If you were using the `DOCKER` runner with a custom Docker image, replace the `docker.image` property with the `containerImage` property.
3. Update any other properties in the `taskRunner` configuration as needed, e.g. to configure Docker image pull policies, CPU and memory limits, or to provide credentials to private Docker registries.

Note that all other script task's properties, such as the `beforeCommands`, `commands`, `inputFiles`, `outputFiles`, `interpreter`, `env`, `warningOnStdErr`, `workerGroup`, and more, remain the same. **You only need to replace the `runner` property with `taskRunner` and adjust the Docker image configuration if needed.**

Let's look at some examples to make this clearer.

### From `PROCESS` runner to `taskRunner`

If you were using the `PROCESS` runner to execute your tasks in local processes, add the `taskRunner` property with the `type` set to `io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process`.

Before (the old way):
```yaml
id: example_with_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    runner: PROCESS
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra

      data = dict(message="Hello from Kestra!", release="0.17.0")
      print(data.get("message"))
      Kestra.outputs(data)
```

After (the current way):
```yaml
id: example_with_taskRunner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra

      data = dict(message="Hello from Kestra!", release="0.18.0")
      print(data.get("message"))
      Kestra.outputs(data)
```

### From `DOCKER` runner to `taskRunner`

If you were using the `DOCKER` runner to run your scripts in a Docker container, add the `taskRunner` property with the `type` set to `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker`.

Before (the old way):
```yaml
id: example_with_runner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    runner: DOCKER
    docker:
      image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/kestrapy:latest
      pullPolicy: IF_NOT_PRESENT
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
      memory:
        memory: "512MB"
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra

      data = dict(message="Hello from Kestra!", release="0.17.0")
      print(data.get("message"))
      Kestra.outputs(data)
```

After (the current way):
```yaml
id: example_with_taskRunner
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
      pullPolicy: IF_NOT_PRESENT
      cpu:
        cpus: 1
      memory:
        memory: "512MB"
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/kestrapy:latest
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra

      data = dict(message="Hello from Kestra!", release="0.18.0")
      print(data.get("message"))
      Kestra.outputs(data)
```

Note how the `containerImage` is now a top-level property of each script task. This makes the configuration more flexible, as the image changes more often than the standard runner configuration.
