This page describes the different storage options available in Kestra.

Kestra uses [internal storage](../04.architecture/09.internal-storage.md) to store data processed by tasks. This includes files from flow inputs and data stored as task outputs.

The default internal storage implementation is the local storage which is **not suitable for production** as it will store data in a local folder on the host filesystem.

This local storage can be configured as follows:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: local
    local:
      base-path: /tmp/kestra/storage/ # your custom path
```

Other internal storage types include:
- [Storage S3](#s3) for [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Storage GCS](#gcs) for [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Storage Minio](#minio) compatible with  others *S3 like* storage services
- [Storage Azure](#azure) for [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)


## S3

First, make sure that the S3 storage plugin is installed in your environment. You can install it with the following Kestra command:
`./kestra plugins install io.kestra.storage:storage-s3:LATEST`. This command will download the plugin's jar file into the plugin's directory.

Then, enable the storage using the following configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: s3
    s3:
      accessKey: "<your-aws-access-key-id>"
      secretKey: "<your-aws-secret-access-key>"
      region: "<your-aws-region>"
      bucket: "<your-s3-bucket-name>"
```

If you are using an AWS EC2 or EKS instance, you can use the default credentials provider chain. In this case, you can omit the `accessKey` and `secretKey` options:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: s3
    s3:
      region: "<your-aws-region>"
      bucket: "<your-s3-bucket-name>"
```

### Assume IAM Role - AWS Security Token Service (STS)

You can configure Amazon S3 storage to utilize **AWS AssumeRole** to temporarily assume the permissions of a specific **IAM** role.
When using AssumeRole with S3, you can omit specifying the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` in your configurations.
Instead, the _default credentials provider chain_ will be used to authenticate with AWS STS and retrieve the temporary security credentials.

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: s3
    s3:
      region: "<your-aws-region>"
      bucket: "<your-s3-bucket-name>"
      stsRoleArn: "<ARN of the role to assume>"
      # (Optional)
      stsRoleExternalId: "<AWS STS External Id>"
      # (Optional, Default: 'kestra-storage-s3-<timestamp>')
      stsRoleSessionName: "<AWS STS Session name>"
      # (Optional, Default: 15m)
      stsRoleSessionDuration: "<AWS STS Session duration>"
      # (Optional)
      stsEndpointOverride: "<AWS Endpoint to communicate with>"
```

## Minio

If you use Minio or similar S3-compatible storage options, you can follow the same process as shown above to install the Minio storage plugin. Then, make sure to include the Minio's `endpoint` and `port` in the storage configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: minio
    minio:
      endpoint: "<your-endpoint>"
      port: "<your-port>"
      secure: "<your-secure>"
      accessKey: "<your-accessKey>"
      secretKey: "<your-secretKey>"
      region: "<your-region>"
      bucket: "<your-bucket>"
```

Optionally and if the Minio configured is configured to do so (`MINIO_DOMAIN=my.domain.com` environment variable on Minio server), you can also use the `kestra.storage.minio.vhost: true` property to make Minio client to use the [virtual host syntax](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/object-management.html#id1).

Please note that the endpoint should always be your base domain (even if you use the virtual host syntax). In the above example, `endpoint: my.domain.com`, `bucket: my-bucket`. Setting `endpoint: my-bucket.my.domain.com` will lead to failure.

## Azure

First, install the Azure storage plugin. To do that, you can leverage the following Kestra command:
`./kestra plugins install io.kestra.storage:storage-azure:LATEST`. This command will download the plugin's jar file into the plugins directory.

Adjust the storage configuration shown below depending on your chosen authentication method:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: azure
    azure:
      endpoint: "https://unittestkt.blob.core.windows.net"
      container: storage
      connection-string: "<connection-string>"
      shared-key-account-name: "<shared-key-account-name>"
      shared-key-account-access-key: "<shared-key-account-access-key>"
      sas-token: "<sas-token>"
```

## GCS
You can install the GCS storage plugin using the following Kestra command:
`./kestra plugins install io.kestra.storage:storage-gcs:LATEST`. This command will download the plugin's jar file into the plugins directory.

Then, you can enable the storage using the following configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: gcs
    gcs:
      bucket: "<your-bucket-name>"
      service-account: "<service-account key as JSON or use default credentials>"
      project-id: "<project-id or use default projectId>"
```

If you haven't configured the `kestra.storage.gcs.service-account` option, Kestra will use the default service account, which is:
- the service account defined on the cluster (for GKE deployments)
- the service account defined on the compute instance (for GCE deployments).

You can also provide the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with a path to a JSON file containing GCP service account key.

You can find more details in the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).
