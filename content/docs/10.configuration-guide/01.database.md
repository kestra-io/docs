This section describes how to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository.


First, you need to configure Kestra to use a database for its Queue and Repository. Here is an example for PostgreSQL:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres
```

Currently, Kestra supports H2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. H2 can be convenient for local development, and for production, MySQL or PostgreSQL are recommended.

Check the [Software Requirements](../09.administrator-guide/00.requirements.md) section for the minimum version of each database.

If you experience performance issues when using PostgreSQL, you can tune the cost optimizer parameter `random_page_cost=1.1`, which should make PostgreSQL use the right index for the queues table. You can also configure `kestra.queue.postgres.disable-seq-scan=true` so that Kestra turns off sequential scans on the queue polling query forcing PostgreSQL to use the index.

## Minimal configuration

In order to connect to a database, you need to configure a `datasource`. Kestra uses The [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) connection pool under the hood, and if needed, you can configure multiple options from the HikariCP documentation directly in your datasource configuration.


### PostgreSQL

Here is a minimal configuration for PostgreSQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: postgres
  repository:
    type: postgres

datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
```

---

### MySQL

Here is a minimal configuration for MySQL:
```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: mysql
  repository:
    type: mysql

datasources:
  mysql:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kestra
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
    dialect: MYSQL
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that we currently don't support the `8.0.31` version of MySQL. If possible, try another version or reach out via [Slack](https://kestra.io/slack) to help you troubleshoot.

### H2

Here is a minimal configuration for H2:

```yaml
kestra:
  queue:
    type: h2
  repository:
    type: h2

datasources:
  h2:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:public;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password: ""
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
```

## Connection pool size

The total number of connections opened to the database will depend on your chosen [architecture](/docs/architecture). Each Kestra instance will open a pool of up to the `maximum-pool-size` (10 by default), with a minimum size of the `minimum-idle` (also set to 10 by default).

- If you deploy Kestra as a standalone server, it will open 10 connections to the database.
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately, it will open 40 connections to the database (10 per component).
- If you deploy each Kestra component separately with 3 replicas, it will open 120 connections to the database.

Usually, the default connection pool sizing is enough, as HikariCP is optimized to use a low number of connections.

## Datasource properties

Here are the datasource configuration properties. For more details, check the [HikariCP configuration](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#gear-configuration-knobs-baby) documentation:

maximum-pool-size: 10
max-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes
validation-timeout: 5000
```

## Queues configuration

### `kestra.jdbc.queues`

Kestra database queues simulate queuing doing long polling. They query a `queues` table to detect new messages.

You can change these parameters to reduce the polling latency, but be aware it will increase the load on the database:

- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-size`: the maximum number of queues items fetched by each poll.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.min-poll-interval`: the minimum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.max-poll-interval`: the maximum duration between 2 polls.
- `kestra.jdbc.queues.poll-switch-interval`: the delay for switching from min-poll-interval to max-poll-interval when no message is received. (ex: when one message is received, the `min-poll-interval` is used, if no new message arrived within `poll-switch-interval`, we switch to `max-poll-interval`).


Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    queues:
      poll-size: 100
      min-poll-interval: 25ms
      max-poll-interval: 1000ms
      poll-switch-interval: 5s
```

### `kestra.jdbc.cleaner`

Kestra cleans the `queues` table periodically to optimize storage and performance. You can control how often you want this cleaning to happen, and how long messages should be kept in the `queues` table .

Here is the default configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  jdbc:
    cleaner:
      initial-delay: 1h
      fixed-delay: 1h
      retention: 7d
```
