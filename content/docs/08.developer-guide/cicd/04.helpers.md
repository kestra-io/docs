Kestra provides some _helper_ functions that can help during flow development.

::alert{type="warning"}
These helpers are only available during flow development to test on your local installation.
Before sending it to your server, you must expand the flow definition; our CI/CD support will automatically expand it.
These helpers cannot be used from Kestra's UI.

## Expand the flow to be uploaded to the server

There is a convenient command on the Kestra executable that allows validation of the current flow and
will output the expanded version of your flow without any helper:

```bash
./kestra flow validate path-to-your-flow.yaml
```

## `[[> file.txt]]`: Include another file

Working on a large flow can become complex when many tasks are defined, especially when you have some big text inside the flow definition (example, SQL statement, ...).

Let's take an example:
```yaml
id: include
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
- id: t1
  type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
  format: |
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
    .....
    500 lines later
```

You can replace the flow definition with this one:
```yaml
id: include
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
- id: t1
  type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
  format: "[[> lorem.txt]]"
```
And have a local file `lorem.txt` with the large content in it.

The path can be:
* `[[> lorem.txt]]`: a relative path from the flow (flow.yaml and lorem.txt are in the same directory),
* `[[> /path/to/lorem.txt]]`: an absolute path,
* `[[> path/to/lorem.txt]]`: a relative path from the flow (flow.yaml with a subdirectory `path/to/`).

When including a file, you must use the right YAML scalar type: literal (with or without quotes) for single-line scalars or folded for multiple-lines ones.


::alert{type="warning"}
Includes are resolved recursively, so you can include a file from another include.
This allows more complex things, but you need to take care that included files don't contain `[[ .. ]]`. If you need to have these characters in included files, escape them with `\[[ ...]]` !

## Validate the flow to be uploaded to the server

There is a convenient command on the Kestra executable that allows validation of the current flow:

```bash
./kestra flow validate --local path-to-your-flow.yaml
```
::alert{type="info"}
If your flow uses a helper function, flow validation must be done locally as the flow cannot be expanded on the webserver. Be careful that the local installation must have the same plugins as the remote installation.

## Expand the flow to be uploaded to the server

There is a convenient command on the Kestra executable that allows expanding of the current flow. It will resolve includes if any:

```bash
./kestra flow expand path-to-your-flow.yaml
```
