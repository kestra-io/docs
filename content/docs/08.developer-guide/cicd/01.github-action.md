We provide two official [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to help you create a CI/CD pipeline for your Kestra flows.

Such a CI/CD pipeline is called a Workflow, and is built with Actions performing validation and deployment of your flows.

To use the GitHub Actions, your Kestra installation must be accessible from the GitHub Actions runner. This means that your Kestra server must be accessible from the internet, or that you must use a self-hosted runner.

## Kestra Actions

Kestra offers two Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline within a GitHub repository.

* [Kestra Validate Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kestra-validate-action) - Validate your flows and templates before deploying anything.

* [Kestra Deploy Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kestra-deploy-action) - Deploy your flows and templates to your Kestra server.

## Examples

Here is an example of a Workflow using the Kestra actions to validate all Flows and Templates before deploying them.

::alert{type="warning"}
Flows should always be deployed before Templates, to avoid flows running before their templates are created.
::
```yaml
name: Kestra CI/CD

on: [push]

jobs:
  # Start by validating all kestra resources
  Kestra_validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Kestra validate
    steps:
      # Validate all templates with the client
      - name: Validate all templates locally
        uses: actions/kestra-validate-action@develop
        with:
          directory: ./kestra/templates
          resource: template
      # Validate all flows with the server
      - name: Validate all flows on server-side
        uses: actions/kestra-validate-action@develop
        with:
          directory: ./kestra/flows
          server: https://kestra.io/
  # If validation passed, deploy resources
  Kestra_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          resource: template
          server: https://kestra.io/
      # We can only deploy in one namespace at once,
      # so we have two different steps for our two namespaces io.kestra and io.kestra.dev
