Kestra currently supports the following programming languages with their own dedicated plugins:

1. [Python](/plugins/plugin-script-python)
2. [R](/plugins/plugin-script-r)
3. [Node.js](/plugins/plugin-script-node)
4. [Shell](/plugins/plugin-script-shell)
5. [Powershell](/plugins/plugin-script-powershell)
6. [Julia](/plugins/plugin-script-julia)
7. [Ruby](/plugins/plugin-script-ruby)

Each of them have the following subgroup of plugins:
- Commands: Execute scripts from a command line interface (good for longer files that may be written separately)
- Script: Write your code directly inside of your YAML (good for short scripts that don't need a dedicated file)

You can also run other programming languages, such as Go and Rust, by using running them inside of a Docker container with [Shell Commands task](/plugins/plugin-script-shell). Check out the dedicated page [here](06.additional-languages.md) to learn more.

## Script Example

In this example, the Python script is inline 

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: "script"
    type: "io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script"
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra
      import requests

      response = requests.get('https://google.com')
      print(response.status_code)

      Kestra.outputs({'status': response.status_code, 'text': response.text})
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install requests kestra
```

## Commands Example


```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: "commands"
    type: "io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands"
    outputFiles:
      - first.txt
      - second.txt
    commands:
      - echo "1" >> first.txt
      - echo "2" >> second.txt
```

## Guides

We have dedicated guides for each of the following programming languages to help you get started. This will show you how to execute code, and handle input and output files.

1. [Python](../../15.how-to-guides/python.md)
2. [R](../../15.how-to-guides/r.md)
3. [Node.js](../../15.how-to-guides/javascript.md)
4. [Shell](../../15.how-to-guides/shell.md)
5. [Powershell](../../15.how-to-guides/powershell.md)
6. [Julia](../../15.how-to-guides/julia.md)
7. [Ruby](../../15.how-to-guides/ruby.md)
8. [Go](../../15.how-to-guides/golang.md)
9. [Rust](../../15.how-to-guides/rust.md)
10. [Perl](../../15.how-to-guides/perl.md)


We also have examples for:
- [C](06.additional-languages.md#c)
- [C++](06.additional-languages.md#c-1)
- [Java](06.additional-languages.md#java)
- [PHP](06.additional-languages.md#php)
