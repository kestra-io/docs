There are several ways of installing custom packages for your workflows. This page shows how to install dependencies at runtime using the `beforeCommands` property.


## Installing dependencies using `beforeCommands`

While you could bake all your package dependencies into a custom container image, often it's convenient to install a couple of additional packages at runtime without having to build separate images. The `beforeCommands` can be used for that purpose.

### pip install package

Here is a simple example installing `pip` packages `requests` and `kestra` before starting the script:

```yaml
id: pip
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: before_commands
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    docker:
      image: python:3.11-slim
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install requests kestra > /dev/null
    script: |
      import requests
      import kestra

      kestra_modules = [i for i in dir(kestra.Kestra) if not i.startswith("_")]

      print(f"Requests version: {requests.__version__}")
      print(f"Kestra modules: {kestra_modules}")
```


### pip install -r requirements.txt

This example clones a Git repository that contains a `requirements.txt` file. The script task uses `beforeCommands` to install those packages. We then list recently installed packages to validate that this process works as expected:

```yaml
id: python_requirements_file
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: cloneRepository
        type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/examples
        branch: main

      - id: print_requirements
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        runner: PROCESS
        commands:
          - cat requirements.txt

      - id: list_installed_packages
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
        warningOnStdErr: false
        docker:
          image: python:3.11-slim
        beforeCommands:
          - pip install -r requirements.txt > /dev/null
        commands:
          - ls -lt $(python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])") | head -n 20
```

And here is a simple version where we add the `requirements.txt` file using the `inputFiles` property:

```yaml
id: python_requirements_file
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: list_installed_packages
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    env:
      PIP_ROOT_USER_ACTION: ignore
    inputFiles:
      requirements.txt: |
        polars
        requests
        kestra
    docker:
      image: python:3.11-slim
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install --upgrade pip
      - pip install -r requirements.txt > /dev/null
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra
      import pkg_resources
      import re

      with open('requirements.txt', 'r') as file:
          # find package names without versions
          required_packages = {re.match(r'^\s*([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)', line).group(1) for line in file if line.strip()}

      installed_packages = [(d.project_name, d.version) for d in pkg_resources.working_set]

      kestra_outputs = {}

      for name, version in installed_packages:
          if name in required_packages:
              kestra_outputs[name] = version

      Kestra.outputs(kestra_outputs)
```

As you can see here, the `WorkingDirectory` task is usually only needed if you use the `git.Clone` task. In most other cases, you can use the `inputFiles` property to add files to the script's working directory.


## Using Kestra's prebuilt images

Many data engineering use cases require performing fairly standardized tasks such as:

- processing data with `pandas`
- transforming data with `dbt-core` (*using a dbt adapter for your data warehouse*)
- making API calls with the `requests` library, etc.

To solve those common challenges, the [kestra-io/examples](https://github.com/orgs/kestra-io/packages?repo_name=examples) repository provides several **public** Docker images with the latest versions of those common packages. Many  [Blueprints](https://kestra.io/blueprints)  use those public images by default. The images are hosted in GitHub Container Registry managed by Kestra's team and those images follow the naming `ghcr.io/kestra-io/packageName:latest`.

### Example: running R script in Docker

Here is a simple example using the `ghcr.io/kestra-io/rdata:latest` Docker image provided by Kestra to analyze the built-in `mtcars` dataset using `dplyr` and `arrow` R libraries:

```yaml
id: rCars
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: r
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
        warningOnStdErr: false
        docker:
          image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/rdata:latest
        script: |
          library(dplyr)
          library(arrow)

          data(mtcars) # Load mtcars data
          print(head(mtcars))

          final <- mtcars %>%
            summarise(
              avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
              avg_disp = mean(disp),
              avg_hp = mean(hp),
              avg_drat = mean(drat),
              avg_wt = mean(wt),
              avg_qsec = mean(qsec),
              avg_vs = mean(vs),
              avg_am = mean(am),
              avg_gear = mean(gear),
              avg_carb = mean(carb)
            )
          final %>% print()
          write.csv(final, "final.csv")

          mtcars_clean <- na.omit(mtcars) # remove rows with NA values
          write_parquet(mtcars_clean, "mtcars_clean.parquet")

      - id: outputs
        type: io.kestra.core.tasks.storages.LocalFiles
        outputs:
          - "*.csv"
          - "*.parquet"
```

Installation of R libraries is time-consuming. From a technical standpoint, you could install custom R packages at runtime as follows:

```yaml
id: rCars
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: r
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.r.Script
        warningOnStdErr: false
        docker:
          image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/rdata:latest
        beforeCommands:
	        - Rscript -e "install.packages(c('dplyr', 'arrow'))" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

However, that flow above might take up to 30 minutes, depending on the R packages you install.

Prebuilt Docker images such as `ghcr.io/kestra-io/rdata:latest` can help you iterate much faster. Before moving to production, you can build your custom images with the exact package versions that you need.
