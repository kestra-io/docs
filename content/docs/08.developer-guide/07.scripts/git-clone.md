title: The Git Clone task

This task allows you to clone a Git repository into a working directory and then use the files from that repository in downstream tasks.

## The `Git` plugin

To use the `io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone` task in your flow, make sure to add it as the first child task of the `WorkingDirectory` task. Otherwise, youâ€™ll get an error: `Destination path "xyz" already exists and is not an empty directory`. This happens because you can only clone a GitHub repository into an empty working directory.

### Add `io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone` as the first task in a `WorkingDirectory`

Adding the `io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone` task directly as the first child task of the `WorkingDirectory` task will ensure that you clone your repository into an empty directory before any other task would generate any output artifacts.

### Private Git repositories
Typically, you would want to use `io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone`  with a private GitHub repository. Make sure to:
1. Add your organization/user name as `username`
2. Generate your access token and provide it on the `password` property.
