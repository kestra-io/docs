If you want to generate files in your script to make them available for download and use in downstream tasks, you can leverage either the `outputFiles` property or the `outputDir` expression.

## Generating outputs from a script task using `outputFiles`

The `outputFiles` property allows to specify a list of files to be persisted in Kestra's internal storage. Here is an example:

```yaml
id: output_text_files
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: python_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    runner: PROCESS
    outputFiles:
      - "*.txt"
    script: |
      f = open("myfile.txt", "a")
      f.write("Hi, this is output from a script ðŸ‘‹")
      f.close()

  - id: read_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - cat {{outputs.python_output.outputFiles['myfile.txt']}}
```

Note how the `outputFiles` property is used to specify the list of files to be persisted in Kestra's internal storage. The `outputFiles` property supports [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).

The subsequent task can access the output file by leveraging the syntax `{{outputs.yourTaskId.outputFiles['yourFileName.fileExtension']}}`.

## Generating outputs from a script task using `{{outputDir}}`

This is an alternative to the `outputFiles` property. Files stored in the `outputDir` directory will be persisted in Kestra's internal storage. Here is an example:

```yaml
id: output_text_files
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: python_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    runner: PROCESS
    script: |
      f = open("{{outputDir}}/myfile.txt", "a")
      f.write("Hi, this is output from a script ðŸ‘‹")
      f.close()

  - id: read_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - cat {{outputs.python_output.outputFiles['myfile.txt']}}
```

The first task creates a file `'myfile.txt'` and the next task can access it by leveraging the syntax `{{outputs.yourTaskId.outputFiles['yourFileName.fileExtension']}}`.

## Which one should you use?

The `outputFiles` property is the recommended way to generate outputs from a script task, as it decouples the orchestration logic (output generation) from your business logic (the script itself). This allows you to use plain Python scripts without having to worry about Kestra-specific templating syntax.

The `outputDir` expression is useful if you want to generate files with dynamic names. For example, if you want to generate a file with a timestamp of the current schedule or execution time in its name, you can use the `outputDir` expression to generate a file with a name such as `myfile-currentExecutionDate.txt`. The expression to accomplish this would be `"{{outputDir}}/myfile-{{trigger.date ?? execution.startDate | date('yyyyMMdd')}}.txt"`.
