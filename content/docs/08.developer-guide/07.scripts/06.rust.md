Kestra is language agnostic. This section shows how to use Rust in your flows.

## Orchestrate Rust scripts

Using `Commands`, you can run arbitrary commands in a Docker container. This means that you can use other languages (such as Rust) as long as:
1. Their dependencies can be packaged into a Docker image
2. Their execution can be triggered from a `Shell` command line.

Here is an example flow using a Rust image created using the following [sample ETL project](https://github.com/kestra-io/examples/tree/main/examples/rust):

```yaml
id: rust_in_container
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: rust
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - etl
    docker:
      image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/rust:latest
    outputFiles:
      - "*.csv"
```

Once the container finishes execution, you'll be able to download all CSV files generated by the Rust container from the Outputs tab.

Note that the `ghcr.io/kestra-io/rust:latest` image is public, so you can directly use the example shown above and give it a try.
