title: Build a Custom Plugin
icon: /docs/icons/dev.svg

Browse [Kestra's integrations](/plugins) and learn how to create your own plugins.

## The purpose of plugins

Plugins are the building blocks of Kestra's tasks and triggers. They encompass components interacting with external systems and performing the actual work in your flows.

Kestra comes prepackaged with hundreds of [plugins](/plugins), and you can also develop your own custom plugins.

To integrate with your internal systems and processes, you can build custom plugins. If you think it could be useful to others, consider contributing your plugin to our open-source community.

## Setup for Plugin Development

### Plugin Template
To get started with building a new plugin, make sure to use the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template), as it comes prepackaged with the standardized repository structure and deployment workflows.

That template will create a project hosting a group of plugins — we usually create multiple subplugins for a given service. For example, there's only one plugin for AWS, but it includes many subplugins for specific AWS services.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that the Kestra plugin library **version** must align with your Kestra instance. You may encounter validation issues during flow creation (e.g. `Invalid bean` response with status 422) when some plugins are on an older version of the Kestra plugin library. In that case, you may want to update the file `plugin-yourplugin/gradle.properties` and set the `version` property to the correct Kestra version e.g.:

```
version=0.17.0-SNAPSHOT
kestraVersion=[0.17,)
```

It's not mandatory that your plugin version matches the Kestra version, Kestra's official plugins version will always match the minor version of Kestra but it's only a best practice.

Then rebuild and publish the plugin.
::

#### Requirements
Kestra plugins development requirements are:
* [Java](https://java.com) 21 or later.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (or any other Java IDE, we provide only help for IntelliJ IDEA).
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (included most of the time with the IDE).


#### Create a new plugin

Here are the steps:

1. Go on the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template) repository.
2. Click on *Use this template*.
3. Choose the GitHub account you want to link and the repository name for the new plugin.
4. Clone the new repository: `git clone git@github.com:{{user}}/{{name}}.git`.
5. Open the cloned directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
6. Enable [annotations processors](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html).
7. If you are using an IntelliJ IDEA < 2020.03, install the [lombok plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok) (if not, it's included by default).


Once you completed the steps above, you should see a similar directory structure:

![Structure](/docs/plugin-developer-guide/plugins-architecture.png)

As you can see, there is one generated plugin: the `Example` class representing the `Example` plugin (a task).

A project typically hosts multiple plugins. We call a project a group of plugins, and you can have multiple sub-groups inside a project by splitting plugins into different packages. Each package that has a plugin class is a sub-group of plugins.

### Plugin icons

Plugin icons need to be added in the SVG format — see an example [here in the JIRA plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-jira/commit/64393190281c9001eb8f57b412a0d7d74f986d41).

**Where can you find icons?**
- for proprietary systems, Wikipedia is a good source of SVG icons
- for AWS services, the [AWS icons](https://awsicons.dev/) is a great resource
- [Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).


## Gradle Configuration
We use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build tool. This page will help you configure Gradle for your plugin.

### Mandatory configuration
The first thing you need to configure is the plugin name and the class package.

1. Change in `settings.gradle` the `rootProject.name = 'plugin-template'` with your plugin name.
2. Change the class package: by default, the template provides a package `io.kestra.plugin.templates`, just rename the folder in `src/main/java` & `src/test/java`
3. Change the package name on `build.gradle`: replace `group "io.kestra.plugin.templates"` to the package name.


Now you can start [developing your task](#develop-a-task) or look at other optional gradle configuration.

### Other configurations

#### Include some dependencies on plugins

You can add as many dependencies to your plugins, they will be isolated in the Kestra runtime. Thanks to this isolation, we ensure that two different versions of the same library will not clash and have runtime errors about missing methods.

The `build.gradle` handle most of Kestra use case by default using `compileOnly group: "io.kestra", name: "core", version: kestraVersion` for Kestra libs.

But if your plugin need some dependencies, you can add as many as you want that will be isolated, you just need to add `api` dependencies:

```groovy
api group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.8.6'
```

## Develop a Task
Here are the instructions to develop a new task.

### Runnable Task

::collapse{title="Here is a simple Runnable Task that reverses a string"}

```java
@SuperBuilder
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
@Schema(
    title = "Reverse a string",
    description = "Reverse all letters from a string"
)
public class ReverseString extends Task implements RunnableTask<ReverseString.Output> {
    @Schema(
        title = "The base string you want to reverse"
    )
    @PluginProperty(dynamic = true)
    private String format;

    @Override
    public ReverseString.Output run(RunContext runContext) throws Exception {
        Logger logger = runContext.logger();

        String render = runContext.render(format);
        logger.debug(render);

        return Output.builder()
            .reverse(StringUtils.reverse(render))
            .build();
    }

    @Builder
    @Getter
    public static class Output implements io.kestra.core.models.tasks.Output {
        @Schema(
            title = "The reverse string "
        )
        private final String reverse;
    }
}
```
::

Lets look at this one more deeply:

#### Class annotations
```java
@SuperBuilder
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
```
These are required in order to make your plugin work with Kestra. These are [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) annotations that allow Kestra and its internal serialization to work properly.


#### Class declaration
```java
public class ReverseString extends Task implements RunnableTask<ReverseString.Output>
```

* `ReverseString` is the name of your task, and it can be used on Kestra with `type: io.kestra.plugin.templates.ReverseString` (aka: `{{package}}.{{className}}`).
* Class must extend `Task` to be usable.
* `implements RunnableTask<ReverseString.Output>`: must implement `RunnableTask` to be discovered and must declare the output of the task `ReverseString.Output`.

#### Properties
```java
    @PluginProperty(dynamic = true)
    private String format;
```
Declare all the properties that you can pass to the current task in a flow. For example, this will be a valid yaml for this task:

```yaml
type: io.kestra.plugin.templates.ReverseString
format: "{{ outputs.previousTask.name }}"
```

You can declare as many properties as you want. All of these will be filled by Kestra executors.

You can use any serializable by [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for your properties (ex: Double, boolean, ...). You can create any class as long as the class is Serializable.

##### Properties validation
Properties can be validated using `javax.validation.constraints.*` annotations. When the user creates a flow, your task properties will be validated before insertion and prevent wrong definition to be inserted.

The default available annotations are:
- `@Positive`
- `@AssertFalse`
- `@AssertTrue`
- `@Max`
- `@Min`
- `@Negative`
- `@NegativeOrZero`
- `@Positive`
- `@PositiveOrZero`
- `@NotBlank`
- `@NotNull`
- `@Null`
- `@NotEmpty`
- `@Past`
- `@PastOrPresent`
- `@Future`
- `@FutureOrPresent`

You can also create your own custom validation. You must defined the annotation as follows:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Constraint(validatedBy = { })
public @interface CronExpression {
    String message() default "invalid cron expression ({validatedValue})";
}
```

And you must also define a factory to inject the validation method:

```java
@Factory
public class ValidationFactory {
private static final CronParser CRON_PARSER = new CronParser(CronDefinitionBuilder.instanceDefinitionFor(CronType.UNIX));

    @Singleton
    ConstraintValidator<CronExpression, CharSequence> cronExpressionValidator() {
        return (value, annotationMetadata, context) -> {
            if (value == null) {
                return true;
            }

            try {
                Cron parse = CRON_PARSER.parse(value.toString());
                parse.validate();
            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                return false;
            }

            return true;
        };
    }
}
```


#### Run

```java
    @Override
    public ReverseString.Output run(RunContext runContext) throws Exception {
        Logger logger = runContext.logger();

        String render = runContext.render(format);
        logger.debug(render);

        return Output.builder()
            .reverse(StringUtils.reverse(render))
            .build();
    }
```
The `run` method is where the main logic of your task will do all the work needed. You can use any Java code here with any required libraries as long as you have declared them in the [Gradle configuration](#gradle-configuration).

##### Log

```java
Logger logger = runContext.logger();
```
To have a logger, you need to use this instruction. This will provide a logger for the current execution and will log appropriately. Do not create your own custom logger in order to track logs on the UI.


##### Render variables

```java
String render = runContext.render(format);
```
In order to use dynamic expressions, you need to render them i.e. transform the properties with Pebble.
Do not forget to render variables if you need to pass an output from previous variables.

You also need to add the annotation `@PluginProperty(dynamic = true)` in order to explain in the documentation that you can pass some dynamic variables.
Provide a `@PluginProperty` annotation even if you didn't set any of its attributes for all variables or the generated documentation will not be accurate.

##### Kestra storage

You can read any files from Kestra storage using the method `runContext.uriToInputStream()`

```java
final URI from = new URI(runContext.render(this.from));
final InputStream inputStream = runContext.uriToInputStream(from);
```

You will get an `InputStream` in order to read the file from Kestra storage (coming from inputs or task outputs).

You can also write files to Kestra's internal storage using `runContext.putTempFile(File file)`. The local file will be deleted, so you must use a temporary file.

```java
File tempFile = File.createTempFile("concat_", "");
runContext.putTempFile(tempFile)
```

Do not forget to provide Outputs with the link generated by `putTempFile` in order for it to be usable by other tasks.


#### Outputs

```java
public class ReverseString extends Task implements RunnableTask<ReverseString.Output> {
    @Override
    public ReverseString.Output run(RunContext runContext) throws Exception {
        return Output.builder()
            .reverse(StringUtils.reverse(render))
            .build();
    }

    @Builder
    @Getter
    public static class Output implements io.kestra.core.models.tasks.Output {
        @Schema(
            title = "The reversed string"
        )
        private final String reverse;
    }
}
```

Each task must return a class instance with output values that can be used in the next tasks.
You must return a class that implements `io.kestra.core.models.tasks.Output`.
You can add as many properties as you want, just keep in mind that outputs need to be serializable. At execution time, outputs can be accessed by downstream tasks by leveraging outputs expressions e.g. `{{ outputs.task_id.output_attribute }}`.


If your task doesn't provide any outputs (mostly never), you use `io.kestra.core.models.tasks.VoidOutput`:
```java
public class NoOutput extends Task implements FlowableTask<VoidOutput> {
    @Override
    public VoidOutput run(RunContext runContext) throws Exception {
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Exception
In the `run` method, you can throw any `Exception` that will be caught by Kestra and will fail the execution.
We advise you to throw any Exception that can break your task as soon as possible.

#### Metrics

You can expose metrics to add observability to your task. Metrics will be recorded with the execution and can be accessed via the UI or as [Prometheus metrics](/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring/prometheus).

There are two kinds of metrics available:

- `Counter`: `Counter.of("your.counter", count, tags);` with args
  - `String name`: The name of the metric
  - `Double|Long|Integer|Float count`: the associated counter
  - `String... tags`: a list of tags associated with your metric
- `Timer`: `Timer.of("your.duration", duration, tags);`
  - `String name`: The name of the metric
  - `Duration duration`: the recorded duration
  - `String... tags`: a list of tags associated with your metric

To save metrics with the execution, you need to use `runContext.metric(metric)`.

##### Name

Must be lowercase separated by dots.

##### Tags

Must be pairs of tag key and value. An example of two valid tags (`zone` and `location`) is:

```java
Counter.of("your.counter", count, "zone", "EU", "location", "France");
```

#### Documentation

Remember to document your tasks. For this, we provide a set of annotations explained in the [Document each plugin](/docs/developer-guide/documentation) section.

### Flowable Task

[Flowable tasks](/docs/concepts/flowable-tasks) are the most complex tasks to develop, and will usually be available from the Kestra core. You will rarely need to create a flowable task by yourself.

::alert{type="warning"}
When developing such tasks, you must make it fault-tolerant as an exception thrown by a flowable task can endanger the Kestra instance and lead to inconsistencies in the flow execution.
::

Keep in mind that a flowable task will be evaluated very frequently inside the Executor and must have low CPU usage; no I/O should be done by this kind of task.

In the future, complete documentation will be available here. In the meantime, you can find all the actual Flowable tasks [here](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/tree/develop/core/src/main/java/io/kestra/core/tasks/flows) to have some inspiration for Sequential or Parallel tasks development.

## Develop a Trigger

Here is how you can develop a [Trigger](/docs/workflow-components/triggers).

::collapse{title="The Trigger example below will create an execution randomly"}

```java
@SuperBuilder
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Trigger extends AbstractTrigger implements PollingTriggerInterface, TriggerOutput<Trigger.Random> {
    @Builder.Default
    private final Duration interval = Duration.ofSeconds(60);

    protected Double min = 0.5;

    @Override
    public Optional<Execution> evaluate(ConditionContext conditionContext, TriggerContext context) {
        RunContext runContext = conditionContext.getRunContext();
        Logger logger = conditionContext.getRunContext().logger();
        double random = Math.random();

        if (random < this.min) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        Execution execution = Execution.builder()
            .id(runContext.getTriggerExecutionId())
            .namespace(context.getNamespace())
            .flowId(context.getFlowId())
            .flowRevision(context.getFlowRevision())
            .state(new State())
            .trigger(ExecutionTrigger.of(
                this,
                Trigger.Random.builder().random(random).build()
            ))
            .build();

        return Optional.of(execution);
    }

    @Builder
    @Getter
    public class Random implements io.kestra.core.models.tasks.Output {
        private Double random;
    }
}
```
::

You need to extend `PollingTriggerInterface` and implement the `Optional<Execution> evaluate(ConditionContext conditionContext, TriggerContext context)` method.

You can have any properties you want, like for any task (validation, documentation, ...), and everything works the same way.

The `evaluate` method will receive these arguments:
- `ConditionContext conditionContext`: a ConditionContext which includes various properties such as the RunContext in order to render your properties.
- `TriggerContext context`: to have the context of this call (flow, execution, trigger, date, ...).

In this method, you add any logic you want: connect to a database, connect to remote file systems, ...
You don't have to take care of resources, Kestra will run this method in its own thread.

This method must return an `Optional<Execution>` with:
- `Optional.empty()`: if the condition is not validated.
- `Optional.of(execution)`: with the execution created if the condition is validated.

You have to provide a `Output` for any output needed (result of query, result of file system listing, ...) that will be available for the flow tasks within the `{{ trigger.* }}` variables.

::alert{type="warning"}
Take care that the trigger must free the resource for the next evaluation. For each interval, this method will be called and if the conditions are met, an execution will be created.

To avoid this, move the file or remove the record from the database; take an action to avoid an infinite triggering.
::

### Documentation

Remember to document your triggers. For this, we provide a set of annotations explained in the [Document each plugin](#document-your-plugin) section.

## Develop a Condition

Here is how you can develop a new [Condition](/docs/workflow-components/triggers#conditions.md).


::collapse{title="Here is a simple condition example that validate the current flow:"}

```java
@SuperBuilder
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
@Schema(
    title = "Condition for a specific flow"
)
@Plugin(
    examples = {
        @Example(
            full = true,
            code = {
                "- conditions:",
                "    - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.FlowCondition",
                "      namespace: company.team",
                "      flowId: my-current-flow"
            }
        )
    }
)
public class FlowCondition extends Condition {
    @NotNull
    @Schema(title = "The namespace of the flow")
    public String namespace;

    @NotNull
    @Schema(title = "The flow ID")
    public String flowId;

    @Override
    public boolean test(ConditionContext conditionContext) {
        return conditionContext.getFlow().getNamespace().equals(this.namespace) && conditionContext.getFlow().getId().equals(this.flowId);
    }
}
```
::

You just need to extend `Condition` and implement the `boolean test(ConditionContext conditionContext)` method.

You can have any properties you want like for any task (validation, documentation, ...), everything works the same way.

The `test` will receive a `ConditionContext` that will expose:
- `conditionContext.getFlow()`: the current flow.
- `conditionContext.getExecution()`: the current execution that can be null for [Triggers](#develop-a-trigger).
- `conditionContext.getRunContext()`: a RunContext in order to render your properties.

This method must simply return a boolean in order to validate the condition.

### Documentation

Remember to document your conditions. For this, we provide a set of annotations explained in the [Document each plugin](#document-each-plugin) section.

## Add Unit Tests

To avoid regression, we recommend adding unit tests for all your tasks.

There are two main ways to unit-test your tasks. Both will be regular Micronaut tests, and hence must be annotated with `@MicronautTest`.

### Unit test a RunnableTask

This is the most common way to test a RunnableTask. You create your RunnableTask, and test output or Exception. This will cover most of the cases.
::collapse{title="Example"}


```java

@MicronautTest
class ExampleTest {
    @Inject
    private RunContextFactory runContextFactory;

    @Test
    void run() throws Exception {
        RunContext runContext = runContextFactory.of(ImmutableMap.of("variable", "John Doe"));

        Example task = Example.builder()
            .format("Hello {{ variable }}")
            .build();

        Example.Output runOutput = task.run(runContext);

        assertThat(runOutput.getChild().getValue(), is(StringUtils.reverse("Hello John Doe")));
    }
}
```
::

This is same as any Java unit tests, feel free to use any dependencies, test methods, start docker containers, ...


### Unit test with a full flow

In case you want to add some unit test with a full flow (In some rare case, it can be necessary; for example, for FlowableTask), here is how you can write the unit test with the full flow.

::collapse{title="Example"}
```java
@KestraTest
class ExampleRunnerTest {
    @Inject
    protected StandAloneRunner runner;

    @Inject
    protected RunnerUtils runnerUtils;

    @Inject
    protected LocalFlowRepositoryLoader repositoryLoader;

    @BeforeEach
    private void init() throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
        repositoryLoader.load(Objects.requireNonNull(ExampleRunnerTest.class.getClassLoader().getResource("flows")));
        this.runner.run();
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    @Test
    void flow() throws TimeoutException {
        Execution execution = runnerUtils.runOne(null, "io.kestra.templates", "example");

        assertThat(execution.getTaskRunList(), hasSize(3));
        assertThat(((Map<String, Object>)execution.getTaskRunList().get(2).getOutputs().get("child")).get("value"), is("task-id"));
    }
}
```
::

With this, you will:
- Inject all dependencies with `@Inject`.
- On `init()`, load all the flow on the `src/resources/flow` directory.
- Run a full execution with `Execution execution = runnerUtils.runOne(null, "io.kestra.templates", "example");`. The first parameter is for the `tenantId` which can be null on tests.

With this execution, you can look at all the properties you want to control (status, taskRunList number, outputs, ...)


To make it work, you need to have an `application.yml` file with this minimum configuration:

```yaml
kestra:
  repository:
    type: memory
  queue:
    type: memory
  storage:
    type: local
    local:
      base-path: /tmp/unittest
```

And these dependencies on your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
    testImplementation group: "io.kestra", name: "core", version: kestraVersion
    testImplementation group: "io.kestra", name: "repository-memory", version: kestraVersion
    testImplementation group: "io.kestra", name: "runner-memory", version: kestraVersion
    testImplementation group: "io.kestra", name: "storage-local", version: kestraVersion
```

This will enable the in memory runner and will run your flow without any other dependencies (kafka, ...).


## Document Your Plugin
Here is how you can document your plugin.

First, let us remember the organization of a plugin project:

- The Gradle project can contain several plugins, we call it a group of plugins.
- The package in which a plugin is written in is called a sub-group of plugins. Sometimes, there is only one sub-group, in which case the group and the sub-group are the same.
- Each class is a plugin that provides one task, trigger, condition, etc.

The plugin documentation will be used on the Kestra website and the Kestra UI.

We provide a way to document each level of a plugin project.

### Document the plugin group

#### Manifest attributes

Kestra uses custom manifest attributes to provide top-level group documentation.

The following manifest attributes are used to document the group of plugins:

- `X-Kestra-Title`: by default, the Gradle `project.name` property is used.
- `X-Kestra-Group`: by default, the Gradle `group.id` property with an additional group name is used.
- `X-Kestra-Description`: by default, the Gradle `project.description` property is used.
- `X-Kestra-Version`: by default, the Gradle `project.version` property is used.

If you follow the plugin structure of the template on GitHub, you should have something like this:
::collapse{title="Example"}

```groovy
group "io.kestra.plugin"
description 'Google Cloud Platform (GCP) plugins for Kestra.'

// [...]

jar {
    manifest {
        attributes(
                "X-Kestra-Title": project.name,
                "X-Kestra-Group": project.group + ".gcp",
                "X-Kestra-Description": project.description,
                "X-Kestra-Version": project.version
        )
    }
}
```
::

As you can see, the most important documentation attribute is the `description`, which should be a short sentence describing the plugins.

#### Additional markdown files

You can add additional markdown files in the `src/main/resources/doc` directory.

If there is a file `src/main/resources/doc/<plugin-group>.md`, it will be inlined inside the main documentation page as the long description for the group of plugins.

For example, for the GCP group of plugins, the file is `src/main/resources/doc/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.md`, and it contains authentication information that applies to all tasks.

If there are files inside the `src/main/resources/doc/guides` directory, we will list them in a `Guides` section on the documentation for the group of plugins.

#### Group Icon

It is possible to provide an icon representing the whole plugin group. If there is a [SVG file](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) `src/main/resources/icons/plugin-icon.svg`, it will be used as the group icon.

### Document the plugin sub-groups

Each sub-group can be documented via the `io.kestra.core.models.annotations.PluginSubGroup` annotation that must be defined at the package level in a `package-info.java` file.

The `@PluginSubGroup` annotation allows setting:

- The sub-group `title`. If not set, the name of the sub-group will be used.
- The sub-group `description`, which is a short sentence introducing the sub-group.
- The sub-group `categories`, which is a list of `PluginCategory`. If not set, the category `MISC` will be used.

For example, for the GCP BigQuery sub-group:

```java
@PluginSubGroup(
    title = "BigQuery",
    description = "This sub-group of plugins contains tasks for accessing Google Cloud BigQuery.\n" +
        "BigQuery is a completely serverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse.",
    categories = { PluginSubGroup.PluginCategory.DATABASE, PluginSubGroup.PluginCategory.CLOUD }
)
package io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery;

import io.kestra.core.models.annotations.PluginSubGroup;

#### Sub-Group Icon

Each plugin sub-group can define an icon representing plugins contained in the sub-group. If there is a SVG file `src/main/resources/icons/<plugin-sub-group>.svg`, it will be used as the icon for the corresponding plugins.

For example, for the GCP BigQuery sub-group, the `src/main/resources/icons/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery.svg` file is used.

### Document each plugin

Plugin documentation will generate a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) that will be used to validate flows. It also generates documentation for both the UI and the website (see the `kestra plugins doc` command).

#### Document the plugin class

Each plugin class must be documented via the following:

- The `io.kestra.core.models.annotations.Plugin` annotation allows providing examples.
- The `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.media.Schema` annotation, which the `title` attribute will use as the plugin description.

For example, the `Query` task of the PostgreSQL group of plugins is documented as follows:

```java
@Schema(
    title = "Query a PostgresSQL server"
)
@Plugin(
    examples = {
        @Example(
            full = true,
            title = "Execute a query",
            code = {
                "tasks:",
                "- id: update",
                "  type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Query",
                "  url: jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:56982/",
                "  username: postgres",
                "  password: pg_passwd",
                "  sql: select concert_id, available, a, b, c, d, play_time, library_record, floatn_test, double_test, real_test, numeric_test, date_type, time_type, timez_type, timestamp_type, timestampz_type, interval_type, pay_by_quarter, schedule, json_type, blob_type from pgsql_types",
                "  fetch: true"}
        )
    }
)
```

For convenience, the `code` attribute of the `@Example` annotation is a list of strings. Each string will be a line of the example. That avoids concatenating multi-line strings in a single attribute.

You can add multiple examples if needed.

#### Document the plugin properties

In a plugin, all properties must be annotated by `io.kestra.core.models.annotations.PluginProperty` and should provide documentation via the `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.media.Schema` annotation and validation rules via `javax.validation.constraints.*`.

The `@PluginProperty` annotation contains two attributes:

- `dynamic`: set it to true if the property will be rendered dynamically.
- `additionalProperties`: you can use it to denote the sub-type of the property. For example, when using a `Map<String, Message>`, you can set it to `Message.class`.

The Swagger `@Schema` annotation contains a lot of attributes that can be used to document the plugin properties. The most useful are:

- `title`: a short description of a property.
- `description`: long description of a property.
- `anyOf`: a list of allowed sub-types of a property. Use it when the property type is an interface, an abstract class, or a class inside a hierarchy of classes to denote possible sub-types. This should be set when the property type is `Object`.

The `@Schema` and `@PluginProperty` annotations can be used on fields, methods, or classes.

Many tasks can take input from multiple sources on the same property. They usually have a single `from` property, a string representing a file in the Kestra Storage, a single object, or a list of objects. To document such property, you can use `anyOf` this way:

```java
@PluginProperty(dynamic = true)
@NotNull
@Schema(
    title = "The source of the published data.",
    description = "Can be an internal storage URI, a list of Pub/Sub messages, or a single Pub/Sub message.",
    anyOf = {String.class, Message[].class, Message.class}
)
private Object from;
```

::alert{type="info"}
Due to limitations on how JSON Schema works, you cannot add `@Schema` on a Java enum type and the plugin property that uses this type. We advise avoiding using `@Schema` on enumerations.

### Document the plugin outputs

Outputs should be documented with the `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.media.Schema` annotation in the same way as plugin properties. Please read the section above for more information.

Only use the annotation mentioned above. Never use `@PluginProperty` on an output.

### Document the plugin metrics

Tasks can expose metrics; to document those you must add a `@Metric` annotation instance for each metric in the `@Plugin` annotation instance of the task.

For example, to document two metrics: a **length** metric of type `counter` and a **duration** metric of `type` timer, you can use the following:

```java
@Plugin(
    metrics = {
        @Metric(name = "length", type = Counter.TYPE),
        @Metric(name = "duration", type = Timer.TYPE)
    }
)
```


## Build and Publish a Plugin
Use the included Gradle task to build the plugin. Then, you can publish it to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com).

### Build a plugin
To build your plugin, execute the `./gradlew shadowJar` command from the plugin directory.

The resulting JAR file will be generated in the `build/libs` directory.

To use this plugin in your Kestra instance, add this JAR to the [Kestra plugins path](/docs/administrator-guide/server-cli#plugins-directory).

#### Use a custom docker image with your plugin

Adding this `Dockerfile` to the root of your plugin project:
```
FROM kestra/kestra:develop

COPY build/libs/* /app/plugins/
```
You can build and run the image with the following command assuming you're in the root directory of your plugin:
`./gradlew shadowJar && docker build -t kestra-custom . && docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 kestra-custom server local`

You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080 and start using your custom plugin. Feel free to adapt the Dockerfile to your needs (eg. if you plan to use multiple custom plugins, include all builds directory in it).

### Publish a plugin

Here is how you can publish your plugin to Maven Central.

#### GitHub Actions

The plugin template includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to test and publish your plugin. You can extend it by adding any additional testing or deployment steps.

#### Publish to Maven Central
The template includes a Gradle task that will publish the plugin to Maven Central. You need a Maven Central account in order to publish your plugin.

You only need to configure the `gradle.properties` to have all required properties:

```yaml
sonatypeUsername=
sonatypePassword=
signing.keyId=
signing.password=
signing.secretKeyRingFile=

```


There is a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file that you can customize to your need:
::collapse{title="Example"}
```yaml
# Publish
- name: Publish package to Sonatype
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
  env:
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
  run: |
    echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
    ./gradlew publishToSonatype

# Release
- name: Release package to Maven Central
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
  env:
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypeUsername: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USER }}
    ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_sonatypePassword: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD }}
    SONATYPE_GPG_FILE: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_GPG_FILE }}
  run: |
    echo "signing.keyId=${SONATYPE_GPG_KEYID}" > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.password=${SONATYPE_GPG_PASSWORD}" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo "signing.secretKeyRingFile=${HOME}/.gradle/secring.gpg" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
    echo ${SONATYPE_GPG_FILE} | base64 -d > ~/.gradle/secring.gpg
    ./gradlew publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
```
