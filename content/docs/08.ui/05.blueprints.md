Blueprints are a curated, organized, and searchable catalog of ready-to-use examples designed to help you kickstart your workflow. Each Blueprint combines code and documentation, and can be assigned several tags for organization and discoverability.

All Blueprints are validated and documented. You can easily customize and integrate them into your new or existing flows with a single click on the "Use" button.
