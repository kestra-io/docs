Get insights into your workflows with the Dashboard.

The first time you access the main **Dashboard**, you'll see the **Welcome Page** and you can click **Create my first flow** to launch a Guided Tour.

Once you have executed a flow, you will see your flow executions in the dashboard.

The Dashboard provides a load of useful data right at your finger tips, including:
- Executions over time
- Execution Status for Today, Yesterday as well as Last 30 days
- Executions per namespace
- Execution errors per namespace
- List of failed Executions
- List of error logs

The dashboard is interactive so you can click on any element to get more information about it.
