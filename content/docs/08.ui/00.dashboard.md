Get insights into your workflows Dashboards.

The first time you access the main **Dashboard**, you'll see the **Welcome Page** and you can click **Create my first flow** to launch a Guided Tour.

Once you have executed a flow, you will see your flow executions in the dashboard.

## Dashboard page

The Dashboard page displays both the **default dashboard** and any **custom dashboards** you’ve created. To switch between dashboards, use the hamburger menu. If you have over 10 dashboards, type the dashboard name in the search bar to quickly find it. The same menu also lets you edit or delete existing dashboards.

Dashboards provides a load of useful data right at your finger tips, including:
- Executions over time
- Execution Status for Today, Yesterday as well as Last 30 days
- Executions per namespace
- Execution errors per namespace
- List of failed Executions
- List of error logs

## Custom Dashboards

Dashboards let you define custom queries and charts to visualize data on your executions, logs, and metrics. Rather than relying only on the default dashboard on Kestra’s home screen, you can create a custom dashboard with charts that answer specific questions and track key metrics.

## Create a new Custom Dashboard as code

Clicking on the `+ Create new dashboard` button opens a code editor where you can define the dashboard layout and data sources as code.

Below is an example of a dashboard definition that displays executions over time, a table that uses metrics to display the sum of sales per namespace, and a table that shows the log count by level per namespace:

## Querying data

The `data` property of a chart defines the type of data that is queried and displayed. The `type` determines which columns are displayed.

Dashboards can query data from these source `types`:
- `type: io.kestra.plugin.core.dashboard.data.Executions`: data related to your workflow executions
- `type: io.kestra.plugin.core.dashboard.data.Logs`: logs produced by your workflows
- `type: io.kestra.plugin.core.dashboard.data.Metrics`: metrics emitted by your plugins

After defining the data source, specify the columns to display in the chart. Each column is defined by the `field` and may include additional optional properties.


| Property | Description                                                                                                    |
| --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `field` | The only required field, specifies the name of the column in the data source to use                           |
| `displayName` | Sets the label displayed in the chart                                                                  |
| `agg` |  Defines the aggregation function applied to the column: supported aggregations include `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM` |
| `graphStyle` | Indicates the style of the graph displayed: supported styles include `LINES`, `BARS`, `POINTS`                          |
| `columnAlignment` | Specifies the alignment of the column in the table: supported alignments include `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CENTER`               |


You can also use the `where` property to set conditions that filter the result set before displaying it in the chart. Filters can apply to any column in the data source. For shared logic, use the `AND` operator in the `where` property to combine several conditions. If multiple conditions are needed with different logic, use the `type: OR` property.

Available filter types include:
- `CONTAINS`
- `ENDS_WITH`
- `EQUAL_TO`
- `GREATER_THAN`
- `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO`
- `IN`
- `IS_FALSE`
- `IS_NOT_NULL`
- `IS_NULL`
- `IS_TRUE`
- `LESS_THAN`
- `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO`
- `NOT_EQUAL_TO`
- `NOT_IN`
- `OR`
- `REGEX`
- `STARTS_WITH`.

Available field types include the following columns:
- `ATTEMPT_NUMBER`
- `DATE`
- `DURATION`
- `END_DATE`
- `EXECUTION_ID`
- `FLOW_ID`
- `FLOW_REVISION`
- `ID`
- `LABELS`
- `LEVEL`
- `MESSAGE`
- `NAME`
- `NAMESPACE`
- `START_DATE`
- `STATE`
- `TASK_ID`
- `TASK_RUN_ID`
- `TRIGGER_ID`
- `TYPE`
- `VALUE`.

Note that some of the above are reserved only for specific types of `data` e.g. the `LEVEL` column is only available for `type: io.kestra.plugin.core.dashboard.data.Logs`.
