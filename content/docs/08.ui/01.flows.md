Manage your flows in one place.

On the **Flows** page, you will see a list of flows which you can edit and execute. You can also create a new flow in the top right hand corner.

By clicking on a flow id or on the eye icon, you can open a flow.

A **Flow** page will have multiple tabs that allow you to: see the flow topology, all flow executions, edit the flow, view its revisions, logs, metrics, and dependencies. You'll also be able to edit namespace files in the Flow editor as well.

Note that if you use the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), you may need to disable the Brave Shields to make the Editor work as expected. Specifically, to view the task documentation, you need to set the `Block cookies` option to `Disabled` in the Shields settings: `brave://settings/shields`.

## Dependencies

The Dependencies page allows you to view what other flows depend on the selected flow, as well as flows that the selected flow depends on. It gives you an easy way to navigate between them as well.
