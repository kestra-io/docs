Manage your flows in one place.

On the **Flows** page, you will see a list of flows which you can edit and execute. You can also create a new flow in the top right hand corner.

By clicking on a flow id or on the eye icon, you can open a flow.

A **Flow** page will have multiple tabs that allow you to: see the flow topology, all flow executions, edit the flow, view its revisions, logs, metrics, and dependencies. You'll also be able to edit namespace files in the Flow editor as well.

## Editor

The Editor gives you a rich view of your workflow, as well as Namespace Files. The Editor allows you to add multipl views to the side:
- Documentation
- Topology
- Blueprints

### Topology View

The Topology View allows you to visualize the structure of your flow. This is especially useful when you have complex flows with multiple branches of logic.

### Documentation View

The documentation view allows you to see Kestra's documentation right inside of the editor. As you move your type cursor around the Editor, the documentation page will update to reflect the specific task type documentation.

Note that if you use the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), you may need to disable the Brave Shields to make the Editor work as expected. Specifically, to view the task documentation, you need to set the `Block cookies` option to `Disabled` in the Shields settings: `brave://settings/shields`.

### Blueprints View

The blueprint view allows you to copy example flows directly into your flow. Especially useful if you're using a new plugin where you want to work off of an existing example.

## Revisions

You can view the history of your flow under the Revisions tab. Read more about revisions [here](../05.concepts/03.revision.md).

## Dependencies

The Dependencies page allows you to view what other flows depend on the selected flow, as well as flows that the selected flow depends on. It gives you an easy way to navigate between them as well.

![Dependencies](/docs/user-interface-guide/dependencies.png)

::alert{type="info"}
The Dependencies View on the Namespaces page shows all the flows in the namespace and how they each relate to one another, if at all, whereas the Flow Dependencies view is only for the selected flow.
