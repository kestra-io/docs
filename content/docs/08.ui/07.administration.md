Manage your Kestra Instance.

## Triggers

The **Triggers** page provides a concise overview of all triggers and their status, and allows you to disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers.

::alert{type="warning"}
The API-side state of a trigger takes precedence over the state defined in the flow code. The state shown on this page is the authoritative source of truth for any trigger. Thus, if a trigger is marked as `disabled: true` in the source code but the UI toggle is on, the trigger is considered active despite being disabled in the code.

## Workers

On the **Workers** page, you will see the list of available [workers](/docs/architecture/worker) and [worker groups](/docs/enterprise/worker-group).

## Stats

The **Stats** page provides a dashboard of Kestra usage statistics, including the number of namespaces, flows, tasks, triggers, executions, and the total execution duration (in minutes). In the Enterprise Edition, this page also shows the number of users, groups and roles.

The main goal of that section is to keep security in mind ‚Äî you can either **consider upgrading** to the Enterprise Edition or **activate basic authentication** for a single user directly from the UI. Here is how this page looks like in the Open Source Edition:

![stats_oss](/docs/user-interface-guide/stats_oss.png)

And here is how it looks like in the Enterprise Edition:

![stats_ee](/docs/user-interface-guide/stats_ee.png)

In both cases, when you click on the üîç **magnifying glass icon**, you can dive into the details of the specific stats.


## Users (EE)

::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).
::

On the **Users** page, you will see the list of users.

By clicking on a user id or on the eye icon, you can open the page of a user.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/17-EE-Users.png)

The **Create** button allows creating a new user and managing that user's access to Kestra.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/18-EE-Users-Create.png)

Users can be attached to Groups and/or Namespaces.

## Service Accounts (EE)

::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).
::

To create a new service account, go to the Service Accounts page under the Administration section and click on the **Create** button. Fill in the form with the required information including the name and description, and click **Save**:

![service_account_create](/docs/user-interface-guide/service_account_create.png)

Once you have created a service account, you can add a Role that will grant the service account permissions to specific resources. To do this, click on the **Add** button and select the role you want to assign to the service account.

![service_account_create](/docs/user-interface-guide/service_account_create.png)

Finally, you can generate an API token for the service account by clicking on the **Create** button. This will generate a token that you can use to authenticate the service account with Kestra from external applications such as CI/CD pipelines (e.g. in Terraform provider configuration or GitHub Actions secrets).

![service_account_create](/docs/user-interface-guide/service_account_create.png)

Note how you can configure the token to expire after a certain period of time, or to never expire. Also, there is a toggle called `Extended` that will automatically prolong the token's expiration date by the specified number of days (`Max Age`) if the token is actively used. That toggle is disabled by default.

Once you confirm the API token creation via the **Generate** button, the token will be generated and displayed in the UI. Make sure to copy the token and store it in a secure location as it will not be displayed again.

![service_account_create_2](/docs/user-interface-guide/service_account_create_2.png)

::alert{type="info"}
Note that you can create an **API token** also as a regular **User**. While Service Accounts are generally recommended for programmatic API access to Kestra from CI/CD or other external applications, often it's useful to create an API token for a regular user, so that programmatic actions performed by that user can be tracked and audited.

## Groups (EE)

::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).
::

On the **Groups** page, you will see the list of groups.

By clicking on a group id or on the eye icon, you can open the page of a group.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/19-EE-Groups.png)

The **Create** button allows creating a new group and managing its access to Kestra.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/20-EE-Groups-Access.png)


It's a collection of users who require the same set of permissions. It's useful to assign the same permissions to multiple users who belong to the same team or project.


## Roles (EE)


::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).
::

On the **Roles** page, you will see the list of roles.

By clicking on a role id or on the eye icon, you can open the page of a role.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/21-EE-Roles.png)

The **Create** button allows creating a new role.

![UI](/docs/user-interface-guide/22-EE-Roles-Create.png)


Roles manage CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) access to Kestra resources such as flows, executions, or secrets. They can be attached to groups or users.

![Kestra Roles Crud](/docs/user-interface-guide/32-EE-Roles-CRUD.png)


## Audit Logs (EE)

::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).
::

On the **Audit Logs** page, you will have access to all Kestra audit logs.

Audit logs record all activities made by all users on the resources created inside Kestra.

By reviewing audit logs, system administrators can track user activity, and security teams can investigate breaches and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
