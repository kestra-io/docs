Manage system stats in Kestra.

The **System Overview** page provides a centralized dashboard with usage statistics for your Kestra instance. It displays the number of namespaces, flows, tasks, triggers, executions, and total execution duration (in minutes).  
In the **Enterprise Edition**, this page also includes additional insights such as the number of users, groups, and roles.

This section also emphasizes security. From here, you can **consider upgrading** to the Enterprise Edition and **manage basic authentication** for a single user directly from the UI.

Below is an example of how the page appears in the **Open Source Edition**:

In the **Enterprise Edition**, the System Overview includes license and usage details, as well as system-level management of Internal Storage and Secret Manager plugins:

![System Overview Enterprise](/docs/user-interface-guide/system-overview-ee.png)

On this page, you can view and manage the available **Secrets Manager** and **Internal Storage** plugins installed at the system level ‚Äî for example, reviewing which JAR versions are available and active.  
However, actual connection configurations (e.g., for an S3 bucket or AWS Secrets Manager) are not defined here. Those settings are configured at the [Tenant or Namespace level](../../06.enterprise/02.governance/tenants.md#dedicated-storage-and-secrets-backend-per-tenant), where you specify environment-specific credentials and connection details.  

While the **System Overview** controls which plugins are available globally, the **Tenant/Namespace** configuration pages handle the setup and usage of those plugins within specific contexts.

In both editions, you can click the üîç **magnifying glass icon** to explore detailed statistics for any metric displayed on the page.
