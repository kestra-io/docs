Manage Triggers in Kestra.

The **Triggers** page provides a concise overview of all schedule-based triggers and their status, allowing you to disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers. This page does not show triggers not handled by the [Kestra Scheduler](../../07.architecture/06.scheduler.md). These include [Flow Triggers](../../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/02.flow-trigger.md) and [Webhook Triggers](../../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/03.webhook-trigger.md); they are handled by the [Executor](../../07.architecture/04.executor.md) and [Webserver](../../07.architecture/08.webserver.md) respectively. They are viewable from a flow's **Triggers** tab.

::alert{type="warning"}
The API-side state of a trigger takes precedence over the state defined in the flow code. The state shown on this page is the authoritative source of truth for any trigger. Thus, if a trigger is marked as `disabled: true` in the source code but the UI toggle is on, the trigger is considered active despite being disabled in the code.
