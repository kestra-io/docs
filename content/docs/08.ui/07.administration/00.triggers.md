Manage triggers in Kestra.

The **Triggers** page provides an overview of all schedule-based triggers and their statuses. From this view, you can disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers as needed.

This page only displays triggers managed by the [Kestra Scheduler](../../07.architecture/06.scheduler.md). Other trigger types — such as [Flow triggers](../../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/02.flow-trigger.md) and [Webhook triggers](../../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/03.webhook-trigger.md) — are managed by the [Executor](../../07.architecture/04.executor.md) and [Webserver](../../07.architecture/08.webserver.md), respectively. These are accessible from a flow’s **Triggers** tab.

:::alert{type="warning"}
The API-side state of a trigger takes precedence over the state defined in flow code. The state shown on this page is the authoritative source of truth.  
If a trigger is marked as `disabled: true` in the source code but appears as enabled in the UI, it is considered active — even though it is disabled in the flow definition.
