Manage Triggers in Kestra.

The **Triggers** page provides a concise overview of all triggers and their status, and allows you to disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers.

::alert{type="warning"}
The API-side state of a trigger takes precedence over the state defined in the flow code. The state shown on this page is the authoritative source of truth for any trigger. Thus, if a trigger is marked as `disabled: true` in the source code but the UI toggle is on, the trigger is considered active despite being disabled in the code.
