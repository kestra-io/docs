To create a new service account, go to the Service Accounts page under the Administration section and click on the **Create** button. Fill in the form with the required information including the name and description, and click **Save**:

Once you have created a service account, you can add a Role that will grant the service account permissions to specific resources. To do this, click on the **Add** button and select the role you want to assign to the service account.

Finally, you can generate an API token for the service account by clicking on the **Create** button. This will generate a token that you can use to authenticate the service account with Kestra from external applications such as CI/CD pipelines (e.g. in Terraform provider configuration or GitHub Actions secrets).

Note how you can configure the token to expire after a certain period of time, or to never expire. Also, there is a toggle called `Extended` that will automatically prolong the token's expiration date by the specified number of days (`Max Age`) if the token is actively used. That toggle is disabled by default.

Once you confirm the API token creation via the **Generate** button, the token will be generated and displayed in the UI. Make sure to copy the token and store it in a secure location as it will not be displayed again.

Note that you can create an **API token** also as a regular **User**. While Service Accounts are generally recommended for programmatic API access to Kestra from CI/CD or other external applications, often it's useful to create an API token for a regular user, so that programmatic actions performed by that user can be tracked and audited.
