Manage Stats in Kestra.

The **Stats** page provides a dashboard of Kestra usage statistics, including the number of namespaces, flows, tasks, triggers, executions, and the total execution duration (in minutes). In the Enterprise Edition, this page also shows the number of users, groups and roles.

The main goal of that section is to keep security in mind ‚Äî you can either **consider upgrading** to the Enterprise Edition or **activate basic authentication** for a single user directly from the UI. Here is how this page looks like in the Open Source Edition:

And here is how it looks like in the Enterprise Edition:

![stats_ee](/docs/user-interface-guide/stats_ee.png)

In both cases, when you click on the üîç **magnifying glass icon**, you can dive into the details of the specific stats.
