Manage Executions of your Flows in one place.

On the **Executions** page, you will see a list of previous flow executions.

By clicking on an execution id or on the eye icon, you can open an execution.

An **Execution** page will allow you to access the details of a flow execution, including logs, outputs, and metrics.

## Gantt

The Gantt tab allows you to see each task's durations. From this interface, you can replay a specific task, see task source code, change task status, or look at task metrics and outputs.

## Logs

The Logs tab allows to access task's logs. You can filter by log level, copy logs in your clipboard, or download logs as a file.

## Topology

Similar to the Editor view, you can see your execution topology. From this, you can access specific task logs, replay certain tasks or change task status.

## Outputs

The Outputs tab inside of an execution page allows to see each task's outputs.

The "Debug Outputs" box allows to evaluate [expressions](../expressions/index.md) on those task outputs. It's a great way to debug your flows.

> Note: You have to select one task to be able to use the "Debug Outputs" button.

For example, you can use the "Render expression" feature to deep-dive into your tasks' outputs and play directly with expressions.

## Metrics

The Metrics tab shows every metric exposed by tasks after execution.
