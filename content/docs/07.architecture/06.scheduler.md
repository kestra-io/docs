The Scheduler is a server component responsible for processing all [triggers](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/index.md) except for the [Flow Triggers](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/02.flow-trigger.md) (managed by the [Executor](./04.executor.md)).

The Scheduler continuously watches all triggers, and if all conditions are met, then it starts an execution of the flow (submit the flow to the Executor).

In the case of [Polling Triggers](../04.workflow-components/07.triggers/04.polling-trigger.md), the Scheduler decides (based on the configured evaluation interval) whether to execute the flow. If the polling trigger conditions are met, the Scheduler sends the execution, along with the trigger metadata, to the [Worker](./05.worker.md) for execution.

Note that polling triggers cannot be evaluated concurrently. They also can't be reevaluated. For example, if the execution of a flow, which started as a result of the same trigger, is already in a Running state, the next execution will not be started until the previous one finishes.

Internally, the Scheduler keeps checking every second whether some trigger must be evaluated.
