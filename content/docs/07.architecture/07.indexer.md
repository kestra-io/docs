**Indexer** is a required component when using Kafka and Elasticsearch to achieve [low latency](../11.migration-guide/0.20.0/elasticsearch-indexer.md). By default, it is merged inside the [Web Server](08.webserver.md), but you can run the Web Server independently by using the `server webserver --no-indexer` CLI command.

The Indexer watches for Kafka topics (including flows and executions) and indexes their content to Elasticsearch.
