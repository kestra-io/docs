Multi-tenancy allows you to manage **multiple environments** (e.g., dev, staging, prod) in a single Kestra instance.

## What is multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy is a software architecture in which a single instance of software serves multiple tenants. You can think of it as running multiple virtual instances in a single physical instance. You can use multi-tenancy to **separate resources** between business units, teams, or customers.

This feature requires a [commercial license](/pricing).

## How does multi-tenancy work in Kestra

By default, multi-tenancy is disabled. When multi-tenancy is enabled, all resources (such as flows, triggers, executions, RBAC, and more) are isolated by the tenant. This means that you can have a flow with the same identifier and the same namespace in multiple tenants at the same time.

Data stored inside the [Internal Storage](./09.internal-storage.md) is also isolated by tenants.

Multi-tenancy functionality is not visible to end-users from the [UI](../08.ui/index.md) except for the tenant selection dropdown menu. That dropdown menu lists all tenants a user has access to, allowing users to switch between tenants easily. Each UI page will also include the tenant ID in the URL (e.g., `https://demo.kestra.io/ui/yourTenantId/executions/namespace/flow/executionId`.)

The [API](../api-reference/index.md) URLs will also change to include the tenant identifier.

For example, the URL of the API operation to list flows of the `products` namespace is `/api/v1/flows/products` when multi-tenancy is not enabled, and it becomes `/api/v1/production/flows/products` for the `production` tenant when multi-tenancy is enabled. You can check the [Enterprise Edition API Guide](../api-reference/enterprise.md) for more information.

Note that tenants must be created upfront, and a user needs to be granted access to use a specific tenant.
