Start Kestra in a Docker container and create your first flow.

::alert{type="info"}
**Prerequisites**: Make sure that Docker is installed in your environment. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Start Kestra

Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest-full server local
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flows.

::alert{type="info"}
The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with Postgres and more configurability, follow the [Docker Compose installation](../02.installation/12.docker-compose.md).

## Create Your First Flow

Navigate to **Flows** in the left menu, then click the "Create" button and paste the following configuration to create your first flow:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: hello_world
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: Hello World!
```

Click on **Save** and then on the **Execute** button to start your first execution.
