## Start Kestra

::alert{type="info"}
**Prerequisites**: Make sure that Docker is installed in your environment. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
::
Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest-full server local
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flows.

::alert{type="info"}
The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with Postgres and more configurability, follow the [Docker Compose installation](/docs/installation/docker-compose).

Click on **Save** and then on the **Execute** button to start your first execution.
