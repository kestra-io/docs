Follow [the tutorial](../03.tutorial/index.md) to schedule and orchestrate your first workflows.

Kestra is an open-source orchestrator designed to bring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices to all workflows â€” from those orchestrating mission-critical applications, IT operations, business processes, and data pipelines, to simple Zapier-style automations.

You can use Kestra to:
- run workflows **on-demand**, **event-driven** or based on a regular **schedule**
- programmatically interact with any system or programming language
- orchestrate **microservices**, **batch jobs**, ad-hoc **scripts** (written in Python, R, Julia, Node.js, and more), **SQL queries**, data ingestion syncs, dbt or Spark jobs, or any other **applications** or **processes**

This tutorial will guide you through **key concepts** in Kestra. We'll build upon the "Hello world" flow from the [Quickstart](./01.quickstart.md), and we'll gradually introduce new concepts including `namespaces`, `tasks`, parametrization with `inputs` and scheduling using `triggers`.

We'll then dive into `parallel` task execution, error handling, as well as custom scripts and microservices running in isolated containers. Let's get started!

## Using JSON Schema to Validate a Flow

Kestra provides a JSON Schema to validate your flow definitions. This ensures that your flows are correctly structured and helps catch errors early in the development process.

### JSON Schema in VSCode

To use the JSON Schema in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps:

1. Install the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) by Red Hat.
2. Open your VSCode settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
3. Search for `YAML: Schemas` and click on `Edit in settings.json`.
4. Add the following configuration to associate the Kestra JSON Schema with your flow files:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://your-kestra-instance.com/api/v1/schemas/flow.json": "/*.yaml"
  }
}
```

Replace `https://your-kestra-instance.com/api/v1/schemas/flow.json` with the actual URL of your Kestra JSON Schema.

### Globally Available Location for JSON Schema

The JSON Schema for Kestra flows is available at the following URL:

```
https://your-kestra-instance.com/api/v1/schemas/flow.json
```

Replace `https://your-kestra-instance.com` with the actual URL of your Kestra instance.
