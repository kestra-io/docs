### Documentation structure

```markdown
---
title: My new page for a +0.18.0 feature

---
```


### Build the documentation locally

The following dependencies are required to build Kestra docs locally:
- Node 18+ and npm
- an IDE (Webstorm or VS Code)

To start contributing:
- [Fork](https://github.com/kestra-io/docs/fork) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```


Use the following commands to serve the docs locally:

```shell
# install dependencies
$ npm install

## Build Kestra locally

### Requirements
The following dependencies are required to build Kestra locally:
- Java 21+
- Node 18+ and npm
- Python 3, pip and python venv
- Docker & Docker Compose
- an IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse or VS Code)

To start contributing:
- [Fork](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/fork) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/kestra.git
$ cd kestra
```

### Backend development
The backend is made with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io).

Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE. In most of decent IDEs, Gradle build will be detected and all dependencies will be downloaded.
You can also build it from a terminal using `./gradlew build`, the Gradle wrapper will download the right Gradle version to use.

- You may need to enable java annotation processors since we are using them.
- On IntelliJ IDEA, click on **Run -> Edit Configurations -> + Add new Configuration** to create a run configuration to start Kestra.
  - The main class is `io.kestra.cli.App` from module `kestra.cli.main`.
  - Pass as program arguments the server you want to work with, for example `server local` will start the [standalone local](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/server-cli#kestra-local-development-server-with-no-dependencies). You can also use `server standalone` and use the provided `docker-compose-ci.yml` Docker compose file to start a standalone server with a real database as a backend that would need to be configured properly.
  - Configure the following environment variables:
    - `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`: can be set to any string and will load a custom configuration file in `cli/src/main/resources/application-{env}.yml`.
    - `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH`: is the path where you will save plugins as Jar and will be load on startup.
  - See the screenshot bellow for an example: ![Intellij IDEA Configuration ](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/.github/run-app.png)
- The server starts by default on port 8080 and is reachable on `http://localhost:8080`

If you want to launch all tests, you need Python and some packages installed on your machine, on Ubuntu you can install them with:

```shell
sudo apt install python3 pip python3-venv
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```


### Frontend development
The frontend is made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and located in the `/ui` folder.

```shell
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```
- Create a file `ui/.env.development.local` with the content `VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080` (or your actual server URL).

- You can serve the UI with hot reload at http://localhost:5173 using the command: `npm run dev`. For a production build, use: `npm run build`.

- If you have CORS restrictions when using the local development npm server, you need to configure the backend to allow the http://localhost:5173 origin in `cli/src/main/resources/application-override.yml` using the following addition to your Kestra configuration YAML definition:

```yaml
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        all:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://localhost:5173
```

### Plugin development
A documentation for developing a plugin can be found in the [Plugin Documentation](./09.plugins.md).
