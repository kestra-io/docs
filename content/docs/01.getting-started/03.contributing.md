## Build Kestra locally

### Requirements

The following dependencies are required to build Kestra locally:
- Java 21+
- Node 14+ and npm
- Docker & Docker Compose
- an IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse or VS Code)

To start contributing:
- [Fork](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/fork) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/kestra.git
$ cd kestra
```

### Backend development

The backend is built using [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io).

Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE. In many IDEs, Gradle build will be detected and all dependencies will be downloaded.

You can also build it from a terminal using `./gradlew build`, the Gradle wrapper will download the right Gradle version to use.

- You may need to enable Java annotation processors since we are using it a lot.
- The main class is `io.kestra.cli.App` from module `kestra.cli.main`.
- Pass as program arguments the server you want to develop, for example `server standalone` starts a standalone Kestra server.
- The Intellij Idea configuration can be found in screenshot below:
![Intellij Idea Configuration ](/docs/contribution/standalone.png)
  - `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`: can be set as any string and will load a custom configuration file in `cli/src/main/resources/application-{env}.yml`
  - `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH`: is the path where you save plugins as Jar and is loaded during the startup process
- If you encounter **JavaScript memory heap out** error during startup, configure `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable with some large value.
    - Example `NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096` or `NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=8192` ![Intellij IDEA Configuration ](/docs/contribution/node_option_env_var.png)
- You can also use the gradle task `./gradlew runLocal` that runs a standalone server with `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=override` and plugins path `local/plugins`
- The server start by default on port 8080 and is reachable on `http://localhost:8080`.

If you want to launch all tests, you need Python and some packages installed on your machine. On Ubuntu, you can install them with the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3 pip python3-venv
$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

### Frontend development

First, we will find all the frontend code in the `/ui` folder.

Our front-end uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). But we do not need deep knowledge of Vue.js to contribute.
To run Kestra's Frontend in dev mode, we will need Node.js version `22.12.0`.
The repository has a `.nvmrc` file.

#### Initial setup

```shell
$ npm install
```

#### Run the frontend

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

This will start a local server on port `5173`.
We will need to open the Kestra UI in a browser at http://localhost:5173

#### Open Storybook (what we use for testing components)

We can also run the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to view the components in isolation.

```shell
$ npm run storybook
```

This will start a local server on port `6006` and open the Storybook in your default browser at http://localhost:6006.
We can also run all tests in the command line without opening a browser:

```shell
$ npm run test:unit
```

Even better, we can run one `test` file or `stories` file in isolation by specifying part of its name or path in the command

```shell
$ npm run test:unit BarChart
```


### Setup the configuration to connect to the backend

Now that we can run the frontend, if we open it, we will see a loading screen running forever.
It waits for a backend to answer.
Let us set it up.

- Create a file `ui/.env.development.local` with the content `VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080` (or your actual server URL).
- To avoid CORS restrictions when using the local development npm server, you need to configure the backend to allow the http://localhost:5173 origin in `cli/src/main/resources/application-override.yml` using the following addition to your Kestra configuration YAML definition:

```yaml
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        all:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://localhost:5173
```

Then, we can run the backend by running the gradle task.

```shell
$ MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=override ./gradlew runLocal server standalone
```

This will start a local server on port 8080 reachable on `http://localhost:8080`.


### Setup Kestra frontend without building the backend from the source code

If you want to work on the frontend without having to install Java and everything to run the Kestra Application, you can start a Kestra [Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and connect the frontend to it.

To do so, you can first use the following [docker compose file](https://gist.github.com/Skraye/9eee812cab84af778d222c64b3bf6748).

Save it as `docker-compose.yml` in a separate directory from the git repo and run the following command in this new directory:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

This starts Kestra running with H2 as the database. In the above docker compose, we redirected the port 8080 to 8085 and 8081 to 8086. You can change it to any port you want by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Next, enter in the `/ui` folder, create a file (or update the file if created above) `ui/.env.development.local` with the content `VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8085` (if you did not use 8085 as the port for Kestra, remember to also change it here).

Finally, install the dependencies with `npm install` and serve the UI with hot reload at http://localhost:5173 using the command: `npm run dev`.

## Kestra Devcontainer

Thanks to the Kestra community, if using VSCode, you can also start development on either the frontend or backend with a bootstrapped docker container without the need to manually set up the environment.

Check out the [README](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/tree/develop/.devcontainer) for set-up instructions and the associated [Dockerfile](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) in the respository to get started.
