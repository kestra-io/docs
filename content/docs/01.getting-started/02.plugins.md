Browse [Kestra's integrations](/plugins), and learn how to create your own plugins.

## The purpose of plugins

Plugins are the core building blocks of Kestra's tasks and triggers. They consist of components that interact with external systems and perform the actual work in your flows.

Kestra comes pre-packaged with hundreds of [plugins](/plugins), and you can also develop your own custom plugins.

## Custom Plugins

To integrate with internal systems and processes, you can [build custom plugins](../plugin-developer-guide/index.md). If you think it could be useful to others, consider [contributing it](../01.getting-started/16.contributing.md) to our open-source community.
