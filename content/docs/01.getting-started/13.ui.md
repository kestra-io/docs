Explore Kestra's beautiful User Interface and the embedded VS Code Editor.

Kestra comes with a rich web user interface located by default on port 8080.
If you followed the [Quickstart](./01.quickstart.md) guide, the UI will be available on http://localhost:8080.

When you first navigate to the Kestra UI, you will see the **Welcome** page.

![Kestra User Interface Welcome Page](/docs/user-interface-guide/01-Welcome.png)

On this page, you can click on **Create my first flow** to open the Kestra __Guided Tour__ which will guide you step by step into creating and executing your first flow.

On the left menu, you will have access to all the functionalities provided by the Kestra UI:

- The **Home** page contains a dashboard of flow executions.
- The **Flows** page allows flow management and execution.
- The **Executions** page allows flow execution management.
- The **Logs** page allows access to all task logs.
- The **Blueprints** page provides a catalog of ready-to-use flow examples.
- The **Settings** page allows configuring the Kestra UI.

The [Kestra Enterprise Edition](/enterprise) comes with additional functionalities provided by the Kestra UI:

- The **Task Runs** page contains a dashboard of task runs.
- The **Namespace** page allows setting specific configurations at the namespace level and enforcing authentication and role-based access control per namespace.
- The **Users** page allows the management of Kestra users.
- The **Groups** page allows the management of Kestra user groups.
- The **Roles** page allows the management of Kestra user roles.
- The **Audit Logs** page allows access to Kestra audit logs.
- The **Custom Blueprints** page allows you to add custom workflow examples to reuse code and share best practices in your team.

## Home Page

The first time you access the **Home** page, as no flows exist, the page will display something similar to the **Welcome Page** on which you can click **Create my first flow** to open the Kestra __Guided Tour__ which will guide you step by step into creating and executing your first flow.

![Kestra User Interface Home Page](/docs/user-interface-guide/02-Homepage-Empty.png)

After the creation of a flow and its execution, you will see a dashboard of flow executions.

![Kestra User Interface Execution Gantt](/docs/user-interface-guide/27-Executions-Gantt.png)

### Logs

The Logs tab allows to access task's logs. You can filter by log level, copy logs in your clipboard, or download logs as a file.

![Kestra User Interface Execution Log](/docs/user-interface-guide/28-Executions-Logs.png)

### Topology

Like in the Editor view, you can see your execution topology. From this, you can access specific task logs, replay certain tasks or change task status.

### Outputs

The Outputs tab in an execution page allows to see each task's outputs.

![Kestra User Interface Execution Outputs](/docs/user-interface-guide/25-Executions-Outputs.png)

The "Eval Expression" box allows to evaluate [expressions](../expressions/01.index.md) on those task outputs. It's a great way to debug your flows.

> Note: You have to select one task to be able to use the "Eval Expression" button.

![Kestra User Interface Execution Outputs Eval Expression](/docs/user-interface-guide/26-Executions-Outputs-Eval-Expression.png)

For example, you can use the "Eval Expression" feature to deep-dive into your tasks' outputs and play directly with expressions.

### Metrics

The Metrics tab shows every metric exposed by tasks after execution.

![Kestra User Interface Execution Metric](/docs/user-interface-guide/29-Executions-Metric.png)

## Namespace (EE)

::alert{type="info"}
This feature requires a [commercial license](https://kestra.io/pricing).
::

When first accessing the **Namespace** page, you will see the list of all Kestra flow namespaces (including parents, as namespaces are hierarchical like a directory tree), but you will not be able to configure a namespace before creating it.

![Kestra User Interface Home Page](/docs/user-interface-guide/14-EE-Namespace.png)

You can click on the **+** icon at the right of a namespace to create it.

![Kestra User Interface Home Page](/docs/user-interface-guide/15-EE-Namespace-Create.png)

After creating a namespace, you can configure it:

- The **Variables** tab allows setting Namespace Variables.
- The **Task defaults** tab allows setting task default scoped to a namespace.
- The **Secrets** tab allows setting Namespace Secrets
- The **Groups**, **Roles**, and **Access** tabs allow managing role-based access control.
- The **Service accounts** tab allows managing service accounts to access Kestra as a service, and not as an end user.
- The **Audit Logs** tab allows access to the audit logs of the namespace.

## Blueprints

Blueprints is a curated, organized, and searchable catalog of ready-to-use examples designed to help you kickstart your workflow. Each Blueprint combines code and documentation and can be assigned several tags for organization and discoverability.

All Blueprints are validated and documented. You can easily customize and integrate them into your new or existing flows with a single click on the "Use" button.

![Blueprint](/docs/user-interface-guide/blueprints.png)

You can also create custom blueprints, shared within your organization.
