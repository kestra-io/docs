Browse [Kestra's integrations](/plugins) and learn how to create your own plugins.

## The purpose of plugins

Plugins are the building blocks of Kestra's tasks and triggers. They encompass components interacting with external systems and performing the actual work in your flows.

Kestra comes prepackaged with hundreds of [plugins](/plugins), and you can also develop your own custom plugins.

## Custom Plugins

To integrate with your internal systems and processes, you can build custom plugins. If you think it could be useful to others, consider contributing your plugin to our open-source community. Check out more on in [Plugins Developer Guide](../plugin-developer-guide/index.md).
