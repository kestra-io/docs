title: Revision

Flows are versioned by default. Whenever you make any changes to your flows, a new revision is created. This allows you to rollback to a previous version of your flow if needed.

If you navigate to a specific flow and go to the **Revisions** tab, you will see a list of all revisions of that flow. You can then compare the differences between two revisions side-by-side and rollback to a previous revision if needed.
