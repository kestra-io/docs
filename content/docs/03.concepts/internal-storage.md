title: Internal Storage
---

Kestra uses an **Internal Storage** to handle incoming and outgoing files of varying sizes. This notion is included in the heart of Kestra. Nowadays, storage availability is backed up by many file systems. We rely on these to guarantee the scalability of Kestra. The *Kestra Internal Storage* will store all the files generated by all tasks and transmit them between different tasks if needed.

By default, only the local storage is available. It uses a directory inside the host filesystem, so it is not scalable and not designed for production usage.

More implementations are available as plugins.

You can replace the local storage with one of the following storage implementations:
- [Storage Minio](https://github.com/kestra-io/storage-minio) for [Minio](https://min.io/), which is compatible with [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and all other *S3 Like* storage.
- [Storage GCS](https://github.com/kestra-io/storage-gcs) for [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
- [Storage Azure](https://github.com/kestra-io/storage-azure) for [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

Kesta's internal storage allows storing arbitrary-sized files inside a dedicated storage area.

If an output attribute is stored inside the internal storage, it will be retrievable from a variable named `{{ outputs.task_id.output_attribute }}`. Kestra will automatically fetch the file when the variable is used.

Inputs of type `FILE` will be automatically stored inside the internal storage.

On the **Outputs** tab of an execution, if an output attribute is from the internal storage, there will be a link to download it.
