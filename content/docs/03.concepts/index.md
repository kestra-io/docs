Understanding key concepts is crucial for harnessing the full potential of any tool. In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Kestra, enabling you to automate your processes efficiently. For detailed information on each concept, please refer to the corresponding pages.


[**Flow**](./01.flows.md): A flow is a sequence of tasks.

[**Task**](./01.flows.md#task): A task represents a discrete action within a flow. Each task can have properties, utilize inputs from the flow, consume outputs generated by other tasks, execute specific actions, and produce outputs for subsequent tasks to consume.

[**Namespace**](./01.flows.md#namespace): A namespace is a way to organize your flows.

[**Execution**](./02.executions.md): An execution refers to a single run of a flow.

[**Task Run**](./02.executions.md#task-run): A task run denotes the execution of an individual task within a flow.

[**Variables**](./03.storage.md#variables): Kestra allows you to utilize variables and process them using the [integrated Pebble language](../05.developer-guide/03.variables/01.index.md). Variables enable dynamic values, configurations, or computed results to be passed between tasks within a flow.

[**Internal Storage**](./03.storage.md#internal-storage): Kestra provides an internal storage mechanism that facilitates the storage of files of arbitrary sizes within a dedicated storage area.
