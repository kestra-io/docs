## What's Pebble ?
Pebble is a Java templating engine inspired by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and similar to the [Python Jinja Template Engine](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) syntax.

In Kestra, it's used for variable operations and passing metadata between tasks.

## How to reading outputs & inputs ?

ðŸ‘‰ very simple tasks with outputs linked from one to the other
ðŸ‘‰ using inputs

## How to parse date ?



### Coalesce operator for trigger or manual execution

Most of the time, a flow will be triggered automatically. Either on schedule or based on external events. Itâ€™s common to use the date of the execution to process the corresponding data and make the flow dependent on time. 
With Pebble you can use the `trigger.date` to get the date of the executed trigger.
Still, sometimes you want to manually execute a flow. Then the `trigger.date` variable wonâ€™t work anymore. For this you can use the `execution.startDate` variable that returns the execution start date.
Using the coalesce operator `??`, itâ€™s easy to make both behavior work without overhead.

```yaml
id: pebble-date-trigger
namespace: demo.kestra.pebble
tasks:

  - id: return_date
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: '{{ trigger.date ?? execution.startDate | date("yyyy-MM-dd")}}'

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "* * * * *"
```

## How to access sibling objects ?




Parse objects and lists
ðŸ‘‰ parse an object
ðŸ‘‰ give data to ForEach type tasks
ðŸ‘‰
Siblings & Conditions
ðŸ‘‰ using siblings element between ForEachParallel and an upstream task
