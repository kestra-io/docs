Send logs back to Kestra.

Your scripts can log to Kestra's backend during flow execution. This allows you to log events occuring during execution of a flow.

## How to log from script tasks

### Logging from Script and Commands tasks

The [Scripts Plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-scripts) provides convenient methods to log to the Kestra backend during flow Execution. Under the hood, Kestra tracks logs from script tasks by searching standard output and standard error for `::{}::` patterns that allow you to specify log messages using a JSON request payload.

Below is an example showing `logs` as list of dictionaries:

```json
{
    "logs": [
        {
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "message": "Hello World from logs!"
        },
        {
            "level": "INFO",
            "message": "Hello World!"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Python

The example below shows how you can log from your Python script to Kestra's backend at runtime:

```python
from kestra import Kestra

logger = Kestra.logger()
logger.debug("Hello World from logs!")
logger.info("Hello World!")
```

Here is a more comprehensive example in a flow:

```yaml
id: logFromPython
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: py
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    script: |
      from kestra import Kestra

      logger = Kestra.logger()
      logger.info("Py task is alive!")
```

### Node.js

Node.js follows the same syntax for sending logs as in Python. Here is an example:

You need to install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kestra-io/libs), that can be done with a `beforeCommands`:

```yaml
beforeCommands:
 - npm i @kestra-io/libs
```

Then, simply use the `require` function to import the Kestra package and emit logs:

```js
const Kestra = require("@kestra-io/libs");

const logger = Kestra.logger();
logger.debug("Hello World from logs!");
logger.info("Hello World!");
```

### Shell

To log from a Shell task, wrap the JSON payload with double colons `'::{"logs": [{"level":"DEBUG","message":"Hello World!"}]}::'` as shown in the following examples:

```bash
echo '::{"logs": [{"level":"DEBUG","message":"Hello World from logs!"},{"level":"INFO","message":"Hello World!"}]}::'
```
The JSON payload should be provided without any spaces.

Here is a comprehensive example in a flow:

```yaml
id: shell_script
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: shell_script
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Script
    containerImage: ubuntu
    script: |
      echo '::{"logs": [{"level":"INFO","message":"Shell task is alive!"}]}::'
```
