title: Script Tasks (Code in Any Language)
icon: /docs/icons/dev.svg

Kestra is language agnostic. Write your business logic in any language.

You can orchestrate custom business logic written in `Python`, `R`, `Julia`, `Ruby`,  `Node.js`, `Powershell` and `Shell` scripts, and you can also build custom plugins in Java.

By default, these tasks run in individual Docker containers (taskRunner type: `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker`). You can overwrite that default behavior if you prefer that your scripts run in a local process (taskRunner type: `io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process`) instead.

If you use a [commercial version of Kestra](../../../06.enterprise/index.md), you can also run your scripts on [dedicated remote workers](../../../06.enterprise/worker-group.md) by specifying a `workerGroup` property or using other [Task Runner types](../../../task-runners/04.types/index.md) for AWS, GCP, Azure and Kubernetes.

The following pages dive into details of each task runner, supported programming languages and how to manage dependencies.
