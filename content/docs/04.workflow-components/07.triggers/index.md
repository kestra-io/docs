Triggers can be scheduled or event-based providing lots of flexibility in how you can automate the execution of your workflows.

## Trigger types

Kestra supports both **scheduled** and **external** events.

Kestra provides five types of triggers:

- [Schedule trigger](./01.schedule-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow on a regular cadence e.g. using a CRON expression and custom scheduling conditions
- [Flow trigger](./02.flow-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow when another flow finishes its execution (based on a configurable list of states)
- [Webhook trigger](./03.webhook-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow based on an HTTP request emitted by a webhook.
- [Polling trigger](./04.polling-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow by polling external systems for the presence of data.
- [Realtime trigger](./05.realtime-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow when events happen with millisecond latency.

Many other triggers are available from the plugins, such as triggers based on file detection events, e.g. the [S3 trigger](/plugins/plugin-aws/triggers/s3/io.kestra.plugin.aws.strigger), or a new message arrival in a message queue, such as the [SQS](/plugins/plugin-aws/triggers/sqs/io.kestra.plugin.aws.sqs.realtimetrigger) or [Kafka trigger](/plugins/plugin-kafka/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.kafka.trigger).


### Trigger Common Properties

Following trigger properties can be set.

| Field | Description                                                         |
| ----- |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`id`| The flow identifier, must be unique inside a flow.                  |
|`type`| The Java FQDN of the trigger.                                       |
|`description`| The description of the trigger.                                     |
|`disabled`| Set it to `true` to disable execution of the trigger.               |
|`workerGroup.key`| To execute this trigger on a specific Worker Group (EE) |

---

## Trigger Variables

Triggers allow you to access trigger metadata through expressions e.g. `{{ trigger.date }}` to access the current date of the [Schedule trigger](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule), `{{ trigger.uri }}` to access the file or message from any file detection or message arrival event, as well as `{{ trigger.rows }}` for all Query triggers e.g. the [PostgreSQL Query](/plugins/plugin-jdbc-postgres/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.trigger) trigger.

This example will log the date when the trigger executes the flow:
```yaml
id: variables
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello World on {{ trigger.date }}! ðŸš€"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@hourly"

```

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that the above-mentioned **templated variables** are only available when the execution is created **automatically** by the trigger. You'll get an error if you try to run a flow containing such variables **manually**.

Also, note that **you don't need an extra task to consume** the file or message from the event. Kestra downloads those automatically to the **internal storage** and makes those available in your flow using `{{ trigger.uri }}` variable. Therefore, you don't need any additional task to e.g. consume a message from the SQS queue or to download a file from S3 when using those event triggers. The trigger already consumes and downloads those, making them directly available for further processing. Check the documentation of a specific trigger and [Blueprints](/blueprints) with the **Trigger** tag for more details and examples.
::

Triggers restrict parallel execution for a given trigger ID to one active run. For instance, if an Execution from a flow with a `Schedule` trigger with ID `hourly` is still in a `Running` state, another one will not be started. However, you can still trigger the same flow manually (from the UI or API), and the scheduled Executions will not be affected.

```yaml
id: hourlyFlow
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: important-task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: If this runs for longer than 1h, next Executions will be queued rather than being started immediately
triggers:
  - id: hourly
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@hourly"
```

## Conditions

Conditions are specific criteria or events that determine when a specific triggers should create a new execution. Usually, they limit the scope of a trigger to a specific set of cases.

For example, you can restrict a Flow trigger to a specific namespace prefix or execution status, and you can restrict a Schedule trigger to a specific time of the week or month.

You can pass a list of conditions; in this case, all the conditions must match to enable the current action.

Available conditions include:

- [HasRetryAttemptCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.hasretryattemptcondition)
- [MultipleCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.multiplecondition)
- [NotCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.NotCondition)
- [OrCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.OrCondition)
- [ExecutionFlowCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExecutionFlowCondition)
- [ExecutionNamespaceCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExecutionNamespaceCondition)
- [ExecutionLabelsCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.executionlabelscondition)
- [ExecutionStatusCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExecutionStatusCondition)
- [ExecutionOutputsCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.executionoutputscondition)
- [ExpressionCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExpressionCondition)

You can also find datetime related conditions [on the Schedule trigger page](./01.schedule-trigger.md#schedule-conditions).

## Unlocking, enabling and disabling triggers

### Disabling a trigger in the source code
If you want to temporarily disable a trigger, you could do so by setting the `disabled` property to `true`, as you can see in the example below:

```yaml
id: hello_world
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: sleep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - sleep 30

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    disabled: true
```

However, this approach requires changing the source code. A better approach is to use the `Enabled` toggle from the UI.

### Disabling a trigger from the UI

You can disable or re-enable a trigger from the UI. Here is how you can do it:
1. Go to the `Flows` page and click on the flow you want to disable the trigger for.
2. Go to the `Triggers` tab and click on the `Enabled` toggle next to the trigger you want to disable. You can re-enable it by clicking the toggle again.

![triggers_flow](/docs/workflow-components/triggers/triggers_flow.png)

If your trigger is locked due to an execution in progress, you can unlock it by clicking the `Unlock trigger` button.

![trigger_unlock](/docs/workflow-components/triggers/trigger_unlock.png)

The **Unlock trigger** functionality is useful for troubleshooting, e.g. if a process is stuck due to infrastructure issues. Note that manually unlocking triggers may result in multiple concurrent (potentially duplicated) executions â€” use it with caution.

### Toggle or unlock triggers from the Administation page

You can also disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers from the Administration page. Here is how you can do it:

![triggers_administration](/docs/workflow-components/triggers/triggers_administration.png)


## Troubleshooting a trigger from the UI

Let's say you misconfigured a trigger, and as a result, no Executions are created.

The example flow below illustrates this scenario. Note how the `sqs_trigger` trigger is misconfigured with invalid AWS credentials:

```yaml
id: bad_trigger_example
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World!

triggers:
  - id: sqs_trigger
    type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.sqs.Trigger
    accessKeyId: "nonExistingKey"
    secretKeyId: "nonExistingSecret"
    region: "us-east-1"
    queueUrl: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789/testQueue"
    maxRecords: 10
```

When you add that flow to Kestra, you'll see that no Executions are created. To troubleshoot this, you can go to the `Triggers` tab on the Flow's page and **expand the logs** of the trigger that is causing the issue. You'll see a detailed error message that will help you identify the problem:

![invalid_trigger_configuration](/docs/workflow-components/triggers/invalid_trigger_configuration.png)


## The ``stopAfter`` property

Kestra 0.15 introduced a generic `stopAfter` property which is a list of states that will disable the trigger after the flow execution has reached one of the states in the list.

This property is meant to be used primarily for a `Schedule` trigger and triggers that poll for conditions including the HTTP, JDBC, or File Detection triggers. However, you can use it with all triggers.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that we don't handle any automatic trigger reenabling logic. After a trigger has been disabled due to the `stopAfter` state condition, you can take some action based on it and manually reenable the trigger.
::


### Pause the schedule trigger after a failed execution

The `stopAfter` property can be used to pause a schedule trigger after a failed execution. Here is an example of how to use it:

```yaml
id: business_critical_flow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
 - id: important_task
   type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
   message: if this fails, we want to stop the flow from running until we fix it

triggers:
 - id: stopAfter
   type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
   cron: "0 9 * * *"
   stopAfter:
     - FAILED
```

The above flow will be triggered every day at 9:00 AM, but if it fails, the schedule will be paused so that you can manually reenable the trigger once the issue is fixed. This is useful for business-critical flows that should not continue running the next scheduled executions if a previous execution has failed.

### Disable the HTTP trigger after the first successful execution

The example below shows how to use the `stopAfter` property with the HTTP trigger condition. The use case is to poll an API endpoint and send a Slack alert if the price is below $110. If the condition is met, the trigger will be disabled so that you don't get alerted every 30 seconds about the same condition.

```yaml
id: http
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: slack
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK') }}"
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#price-alerts",
        "text": "The price is now: {{ json(trigger.body).price }}"
      }

triggers:
  - id: http
    type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.Trigger
    uri: https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1
    responseCondition: "{{ json(response.body).price <= 110 }}"
    interval: PT30S
    stopAfter:
      - SUCCESS
```

Let's break down the above example:
1. The HTTP trigger will poll the API endpoint every 30 seconds to check if the price of a product is below $110.
2. If the condition is met, the Execution will be created
3. Within that execution, the `slack` task will send a Slack message to the `#price-alerts` channel to notify about the price change
4. After that execution finishes successfully, the `stopAfter` property condition is met â€” it will disable the trigger ensuring that you don't get alerted every 30 seconds about the same condition.


## Locked triggers

[Flow](./02.flow-trigger.md), [Schedule](./01.schedule-trigger.md) and [Polling triggers](./04.polling-trigger.md) have locks to avoid concurrent trigger evaluation and concurrent execution of a flow for a trigger.

To see a list of triggers and inspect their current status, go to the **Administration -> Triggers** section in the Kestra UI. From here, you can unlock a trigger if it is locked. Keep in mind that there is a risk or concurrent trigger evaluation or flow execution for this trigger if you unlock it manually.

## Setting Inputs inside of triggers 

You can easily pass inputs to triggers by using the `inputs` property and passing them as a key-value pair.

In this example, the `user` input is set to "John Smith" inside of the `schedule` trigger:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    defaults: Rick Astley

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello {{ inputs.user }}! ðŸš€"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    inputs:
      user: John Smith
```
