Schedule flows with cron expressions.

The Schedule trigger generates new executions on a regular cadence based on a Cron expression or custom scheduling conditions.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule"
```

Kestra is able to trigger flows based on a Schedule (aka the time). If you need to wait for another system to be ready and cannot use any event mechanism, you can schedule one or more time the current flow.

Kestra will optionally handle schedule [backfills](../../05.concepts/08.backfill.md) if any executions are missed.

Check the [Schedule task](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule) documentation for the list of the task properties and outputs.


## Example: A schedule that runs every quarter of an hour.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
```

A schedule that runs only the first monday of every month at 11 AM.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 11 * * 1"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekInMonthCondition
        date: "{{ trigger.date }}"
        dayOfWeek: "MONDAY"
        dayInMonth: "FIRST"
```

A schedule that runs daily at midnight US Eastern time.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"
    timezone: America/New_York
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Schedules **cannot overlap**. This means that we **cannot have any concurrent schedules**. If the previous schedule is not ended when the next one must start, the scheduler will wait until the end of the previous one. The same applies during backfills.
::

::alert{type="info"}
Most of the time, schedule execution will depend on the `trigger.date` (looking at files for today, SQL query with the schedule date in the where clause, ...). This works well but prevents you from executing your flow manually (since these variables are only available during the schedule).

You can use this expression to make your **manual execution work**: `{{ trigger.date ?? execution.startDate | date("yyyy-MM-dd") }}`. It will use the current date if there is no schedule date making it possible to start the flow manually.

## Schedule Conditions

When the `cron` is not sufficient to determine the date you want to schedule your flow, you can use `conditions` to add additional conditions, (for example, only the first day of the month, only the weekend, ...).

You **must** use the `{{ trigger.date }}` expression on the property `date` of the current schedule.

This condition will be evaluated and `{{ trigger.previous }}` and `{{ trigger.next }}` will reflect the date **with** the conditions applied.

The list of core conditions that can be used are:

 - [DateTimeBetweenCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DateTimeBetweenCondition)
 - [DayWeekCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekCondition)
 - [DayWeekInMonthCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekInMonthCondition)
 - [NotCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.NotCondition)
 - [OrCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.OrCondition)
 - [WeekendCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.WeekendCondition)
 - [PublicHolidayCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.publicholidaycondition)
 - [TimeBetweenCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.timebetweencondition)

Here's an example using the `DayWeekCondition`:

```yaml
id: conditions
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: This will execute only on Thursday!

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@hourly"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekCondition
        dayOfWeek: "THURSDAY"
```

## Recover Missed Schedules

### Automatically

If a schedule is missed, Kestra will automatically recover it by default. This means that if the Kestra server is down, the missed schedules will be executed as soon as the server is back up. However, this behavior is not always desirable, e.g. during a planned maintenance window. In Kestra 0.15 and higher, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration to `NONE`.

Kestra 0.15 introduced a new configuration allowing you to choose whether you want to recover missed schedules or not:

```yaml
kestra:
  plugins:
    configurations:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
        values:
          # available options: LAST | NONE | ALL -- default: ALL
          recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

The `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration can be set to `ALL`, `NONE` or `LAST`:
- `ALL`: Kestra will recover all missed schedules. This is the **default** value.
- `NONE`: Kestra will not recover any missed schedules.
- `LAST`: Kestra will recover only the last missed schedule for each flow.

Note that this is a global configuration that will apply to all flows, unless other behavior is explicitly defined within the flow definition:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
    recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

In this example, the `recoverMissedSchedules` is set to `NONE`, which means that Kestra will not recover any missed schedules for this specific flow regardless of the global configuration.

### Using Backfill

Backfills are replays of missed schedule intervals between a defined start and end date.

To backfill the missed executions, go to the `Triggers` tab on the Flow's detail page and click on the `Backfill executions` button.

![backfill1](/docs/workflow-components/backfill1.png)

For more information on Backfill, check out the [dedicated documentation](../../05.concepts/08.backfill.md).

#### Disabling the trigger

If you're unsure what how you want to proceed and need to time to decide, you can disable the trigger by either adding the `disabled: true` property to your YAML or by toggling on the Triggers page.

This is useful if you're figuring out what to do before the next schedule is due to run.

For more information on Disabled, check out the [dedicated documentation](../16.disabled.md).

## Setting Inputs inside of the Schedule trigger 

You can easily pass inputs to the Schedule Trigger by using the `inputs` property and passing them as a key-value pair.

In this example, the `user` input is set to "John Smith" inside of the `schedule` trigger:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    defaults: Rick Astley

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello {{ inputs.user }}! 🚀"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    inputs:
      user: John Smith
```
