Schedule flows using cron expressions.

The Schedule trigger generates new executions on a regular cadence based on a Cron expression or custom scheduling conditions.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule"
```

Kestra can trigger flows on a defined schedule. If you need to wait for another system to be ready and no event mechanism is available, you can configure one or more time-based schedules for your flow.

Kestra can automatically handle [backfills](../../05.concepts/08.backfill.md) to recover missed executions.

Check the [Schedule task](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule) documentation for the list of the task properties and outputs.

To avoid unexpected differences, keep your Kestra server and database timezones aligned. If this isnâ€™t possible, account for timezone implications such as Daylight Saving Time or regional variations.

## Examples 

Schedule that runs every 15 minutes:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
```

Schedule that runs only on the first monday of every month at 11 AM:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 11 * * 1"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekInMonth
        date: "{{ trigger.date }}"
        dayOfWeek: "MONDAY"
        dayInMonth: "FIRST"
```

A schedule that runs daily at midnight US Eastern time:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"
    timezone: America/New_York
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Schedules cannot **overlap**, meaning concurrent schedule executions are not allowed. If the previous schedule is not ended when the next one must start, the scheduler will wait until the end of the previous one. The same applies during backfills.
::

::alert{type="info"}
By default, schedule executions depend on `trigger.date`. For example, this may be used when querying files or databases by date. However, this prevents manual execution since trigger.date is only available for scheduled runs.

You can use this expression to make your **manual execution work**: `{{ trigger.date ?? execution.startDate | date("yyyy-MM-dd") }}`. It will use the current date if there is no schedule date making it possible to start the flow manually.

## Schedule Conditions

When a `cron` expression alone is not sufficient (e.g., only first Monday of the month, only weekends), you can refine schedules using `conditions`.

You **must** use the `{{ trigger.date }}` expression on the property `date` of the current schedule.

This condition will be evaluated and `{{ trigger.previous }}` and `{{ trigger.next }}` will reflect the date **with** the conditions applied.

The list of core conditions that can be used are:

 - [DateTimeBetween](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DateTimeBetween)
 - [DayWeek](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeek)
 - [DayWeekInMonth](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeekInMonth)
 - [Not](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.Not)
 - [Or](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.Or)
 - [Weekend](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.Weekend)
 - [PublicHoliday](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.publicholiday)
 - [TimeBetween](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.timebetween)

Here's an example using the `DayWeek` condition:

```yaml
id: conditions
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: This will execute only on Thursday!

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@hourly"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.DayWeek
        dayOfWeek: "THURSDAY"
```

## Recover Missed Schedules

### Automatically

By default, Kestra automatically recovers missed schedules. This means that if the Kestra server is down, the missed schedules will be executed as soon as the server is back up. However, this behavior is not always desirable, e.g. during a planned maintenance window. In Kestra 0.15 and higher, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration to `NONE`.

Kestra 0.15 introduced a new configuration allowing you to choose whether you want to recover missed schedules or not:

```yaml
kestra:
  plugins:
    configurations:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
        values:
          # available options: LAST | NONE | ALL -- default: ALL
          recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

The `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration can be set to `ALL`, `NONE` or `LAST`:
- `ALL`: Kestra will recover all missed schedules. This is the **default** value.
- `NONE`: Kestra will not recover any missed schedules.
- `LAST`: Kestra will recover only the last missed schedule for each flow.

Note that this is a global configuration that will apply to all flows, unless other behavior is explicitly defined within the flow definition:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
    recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

In this example, the `recoverMissedSchedules` is set to `NONE`, which means that Kestra will not recover any missed schedules for this specific flow regardless of the global configuration.

### Using Backfill

Backfills are replays of missed schedule intervals between a defined start and end date.

To backfill the missed executions, go to the `Triggers` tab on the flow's detail page and click on the `Backfill executions` button.

![backfill1](/docs/workflow-components/backfill1.png)

For more information on Backfill, check out the [dedicated documentation](../../05.concepts/08.backfill.md).

#### Disabling the trigger

If you are unsure how to proceed, you can temporarily disable the trigger by setting `disabled: true` in the YAML or toggling it in the UI.

This is useful if you are figuring out what to do before the next schedule is due to run.

For more information on Disabled, check out the [dedicated documentation](../16.disabled.md).

## Setting Inputs inside of the Schedule trigger 

You can easily pass inputs to the Schedule Trigger by using the `inputs` property and passing them as a key-value pair.

In this example, the `user` input is set to "John Smith" inside of the `schedule` trigger:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    defaults: Rick Astley

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello {{ inputs.user }}! ðŸš€"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    inputs:
      user: John Smith
```
