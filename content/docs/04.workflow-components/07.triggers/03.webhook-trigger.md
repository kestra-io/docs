Trigger flows automatically in response to web-based events.

A Webhook trigger generates a unique URL that lets external applications (such as GitHub, Amazon EventBridge, or any system that can send HTTP requests) automatically start new executions in Kestra.

Each webhook URL requires a secret `key` to secure it. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures only trusted systems can trigger your flow.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Webhook"
```

A Webhook trigger enables triggering a flow from a webhook URL.
When you create the trigger, you must provide a `key`. This `key` is embedded in the webhook URL: `/api/v1/main/executions/webhook/{namespace}/{flowId}/{key}`.

For security, use a randomly generated string rather than something easy to guess. Kestra accepts `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests on the webhook URL. Both the request body and headers are automatically available as variables inside your flow.

Starting in Kestra 0.24, [Basic Authentication is required](../../11.migration-guide/0.24.0/basic-authentication.md) for all instances. This change makes it so API requests require an `Authorization` header. Follow these [Basic Authentication Encoding Steps](../../15.how-to-guides/synchonous-executions-api.md#basic-authentication) to configure requests correctly.

## Example

```yaml
id: trigger
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello World! ðŸš€"

triggers:
  - id: webhook
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Webhook
    key: 4wjtkzwVGBM9yKnjm3yv8r
```

After creating the trigger, include the key in the webhook URL to start the flow. For example:

```bash
https://{kestra_domain}/api/v1/main/executions/webhook/{namespace}/{flowId}/4wjtkzwVGBM9yKnjm3yv8r
```

Make sure to replace `kestra_domain`, `namespace`, and `flowId`.

You can also copy the formed Webhook URL from the **Triggers** tab.

## Webhook Trigger Testing

If your flow uses trigger variables (such as `{{ trigger.body }})`, you can test it directly from the execution modal. Kestra generates a ready-to-use `cURL` command that lets you trigger the flow with a custom JSON payload.
