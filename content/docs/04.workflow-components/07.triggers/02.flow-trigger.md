Trigger one flow based on the execution of another flow.

A Flow trigger runs a flow after another flow completes, enabling event-driven workflows and dependencies across teams.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow"
```

Kestra can automatically start a flow as soon as another flow ends. This allows you to create dependencies between flows, even when those flows are owned by different teams.

Check the [Flow trigger](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow) documentation for the list of all properties.

## Preconditions

A Flow trigger requires preconditions to filter which upstream executions can trigger the flow, often within a defined time window.

:::alert{type="info"}
[Pebble expressions](../../expressions/index.md) cannot be used in Flow Trigger (pre)conditions. You must declaratively define any condition variables.
:::

### Filters

- `flows`: A list of preconditions to meet, in the form of upstream flows

The example below shows a Flow trigger that runs when `flow_a` completes successfully.

```yaml
id: flow_b
namespace: kestra.sandbox

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Hello World!"

triggers:
  - id: upstream_dependancy
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    preconditions:
      id: flow_trigger
      flows:
        - namespace: kestra.sandbox
          flowId: flow_a
          states: [SUCCESS]
```

::alert{type="info"}
It is [best practice](../../14.best-practices/0.flows.md#flow-trigger-on-state-change) when using a flow trigger to use `preconditions.flows.states` rather than the `states` task property when defining state conditions for one specific flow.
::

- `where`

You can filter executions based on fields like `FLOW_ID`, `NAMESPACE`, `STATE`, and `EXPRESSION`.

For example, the following Flow Trigger triggers on execution from flows in FAILED or WARNING states in namespaces starting with "company":

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: alert_on_failure
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    states:
      - FAILED
      - WARNING
    preconditions:
      id: company_namespace
      where:
        - id: company
          filters:
            - field: NAMESPACE
              type: STARTS_WITH
              value: company
```

### Time Window & SLA

The `timeWindow` property lets you define how Kestra evaluates upstream flow executions over time. It supports several modes:

- `DURATION_WINDOW`: This is the default type. It uses a start time (windowAdvance) and end time (window) that are moving forward to the next interval whenever the evaluation time reaches the end time, based on the defined duration window.

For example, with a 1-day window (`window: PT1D`, the default), SLA conditions are evaluated over a 24-hour period starting at midnight each day. If you set `windowAdvance: PT6H`, the window will start at 6 AM each day. If you set `windowAdvance: PT6H` and you also override `window: PT6H`, the window will start at 6 AM and last for 6 hours — as a result, Kestra will check the SLA conditions during the following time periods: 06:00 to 12:00, 12:00 to 18:00, 18:00 to 00:00, and 00:00 to 06:00, and so on.

- `SLIDING_WINDOW`: This option also evaluates SLA conditions over a fixed time window, but it always goes backward from the current time. For example, a sliding window of 1 hour (window: PT1H) will evaluate executions for the past hour (so between now and one hour before now). It uses a default window of 1 day.

For example, the flow below evaluates every hour if the flow `flow_a` is in SUCCESS state. If so, it triggers the `flow_b` passing corresponding inputs (reading `flow_a` outputs).

```yaml
id: flow_b
namespace: kestra.sandbox

inputs:
  - id: value_from_a
    type: STRING

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ inputs.value_from_a }}"

triggers:
  - id: upstream_dep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    inputs:
      value_from_a: "{{ trigger.outputs.return_value }}"
    preconditions:
      id: test
      flows:
        - namespace: kestra.sandbox
          flowId: flow_a
          states: [SUCCESS]
      timeWindow:
        type: SLIDING_WINDOW
        window: PT1H
```

For reference, below is `flow_a`:

```yaml
id: flow_a
namespace: kestra.sandbox

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World! 🚀

outputs:
  - id: return_value
    type: STRING
    value: "Flow A run succesfully"
```


- `DAILY_TIME_DEADLINE`: This option enforces SLA conditions that must be met before a specific cutoff time each day. With the string property deadline, you can configure a daily cutoff for checking conditions. For example, deadline: "09:00:00.00Z" means that the defined SLA conditions should be met from midnight until 9 AM each day; otherwise, the flow will not be triggered.

For the example, this trigger definition only triggers the flow if  `flow_a` is in SUCCESS state before 9:00 AM every day.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: upstream_dep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    preconditions:
      id: should_be_success_by_nine
      flows:
        - namespace: kestra.sandbox
          flowId: flow_a
          states: [SUCCESS]
      timeWindow:
        type: DAILY_TIME_DEADLINE
        deadline: "09:00:00.00Z"
```

- `DAILY_TIME_WINDOW`: This option enforces SLA conditions that must be met within a specific daily time range. For example, a window from `startTime: "06:00:00"` to `endTime: "09:00:00"` evaluates executions within that interval each day. This option is particularly useful for declarative definition of freshness conditions when building data pipelines. For example, if you only need one successful execution within a given time range to guarantee that some data has been successfully refreshed in order for you to proceed with the next steps of your pipeline, this option can be more useful than a strict DAG-based approach. Usually, each failure in your flow would block the entire pipeline, whereas with this option, you can proceed with the next steps of the pipeline as soon as the data is successfully refreshed at least once within the given time range.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: upstream_dep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    inputs:
      value_from_a: "{{ trigger.outputs.return_value }}"
    preconditions:
      id: test
      flows:
        - namespace: kestra.sandbox
          flowId: flow_a
          states: [SUCCESS]
      timeWindow:
        type: DAILY_TIME_WINDOW
        startTime: "06:00:00"
        endTime: "12:00:00"
```



## Example

This example triggers the `silver_layer` flow once the `bronze_layer` flow finishes successfully by 9 AM. The deadline time string must include the timezone offset. This ensures that no new executions are triggered past the deadline. Here is the `silver_layer` flow:

```yaml
id: silver_layer
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: transform_data
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: deduplication, cleaning, and minor aggregations
triggers:
  - id: flow_trigger
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    preconditions:
      id: bronze_layer
      timeWindow:
        type: DAILY_TIME_DEADLINE
        deadline: "09:00:00+01:00"
      flows:
        - namespace: company.team
          flowId: bronze_layer
          states: [SUCCESS]
```

## Example: Alerting

This example creates a `System Flow` to send a Slack alert on any failure or warning state within the `company` namespace. This example uses the Slack webhook secret to notify the `#general` channel about the failed flow.

```yaml
id: alert
namespace: system
tasks:
  - id: send_alert
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackExecution
    url: "{{secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK')}}" # format: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xzy/xyz/xyz
    channel: "#general"
    executionId: "{{trigger.executionId}}"
triggers:
  - id: alert_on_failure
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Flow
    states:
      - FAILED
      - WARNING
    preconditions:
      id: company_namespace
      where:
        - id: company
          filters:
            - field: NAMESPACE
              type: STARTS_WITH
              value: company
```
