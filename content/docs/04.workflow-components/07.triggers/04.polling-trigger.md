title: Polling Trigger

Trigger flows automatically by polling external systems for new data or events.

Polling triggers repeatedly check an external system at a fixed interval. When new data or events are detected, they automatically start a new flow execution.

Kestra provides polling triggers for a wide variety of systems, including databases, message queues, cloud storage, and FTP servers.

The polling frequency is controlled by the `interval` property. When triggered, the flow has access to the polling results through the `trigger` variable, making the retrieved data immediately available for downstream tasks.

## Example

For example, the following flow polls a PostgreSQL table every 5 minutes. When new rows are available, it deletes them (to prevent duplicate processing) and logs the retrieved values.

```yaml
id: jdbc-trigger
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: db_url
    type: STRING

tasks:
- id: update
  type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Query
  url: "{{ inputs.db_url }}"
  sql: DELETE * FROM my_table

- id: log
  type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
  message: "{{ trigger.rows }}"

triggers:
  - id: watch
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Trigger
    url: myurl
    interval: "PT5M"
    sql: "SELECT * FROM my_table"
```

In [Enterprise Edition](../../06.enterprise/01.overview/01.enterprise-edition.md), you can assign polling triggers to a specific [Worker Group](../../06.enterprise/04.scalability/worker-group.md) using the `workerGroup.key` property. This allows you to control where the polling is executed.

## Enterprise Example

In Enterprise Edition (Kestra 0.24+), the `Salesforce Trigger` enables flows to start automatically when new records are created in Salesforce. For example, the flow below sends a Slack notification whenever a new contact is added.

```yaml
id: salesforce_contact_trigger
namespace: company.sales
tasks:
  - id: notify_sales_manager
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL') }}"
    messageText: "New contact created" 

triggers:
  - id: new_contact_trigger
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.salesforce.Trigger
    interval: "PT5M"
    connection:
      username: "{{ secret('SALESFORCE_USERNAME') }}"
      password: "{{ secret('SALESFORCE_PASSWORD') }}"
      authEndpoint: "{{ secret('SALESFORCE_AUTH_ENDPOINT') }}"
    query: "SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Company, CreatedDate FROM Contact WHERE CreatedDate >= LAST_N_MINUTES:5"
```
