Run tasks **after** the execution of the flow.

`afterExecution` tasks run after a flow execution is complete, capturing the final execution status.

## `afterExecution` property

`afterExecution` is a block of tasks that run after a flow execution has completed. This allows you to run conditional tasks on **SUCCESS** or **FAILED** result. This is particularly useful for creating custom notifications and alerts. For example, you can combine the `afterExecution` component with the `runIf` task property to send out different Slack alerts depending on the task's final state.

```yaml
id: alerts_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

afterExecution:
  - id: onSuccess
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'SUCCESS'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "{{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} finished successfully!"
      }
  - id: onFailure
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'FAILED'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Oh no, {{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} failed!!!"
      }
```

## `afterExecution` vs `finally`

`afterExecution` and `finally` are both end of flow components but have separate use cases.

The `afterExecution` property differs from the `finally` property because:
1. `finally` runs tasks at the end of the flow while the execution is still in a `RUNNING` state.
2. `afterExecution` runs tasks after the execution finishes in a terminal state like **SUCCESS** or **FAILED**.

Considering the above, `finally` is best used to run cleanup operations at the end of a flow when the end state does not matter. Check out the [`finally` documentation](19.finally.md) for more examples. When the end state does matter as a condition for followup actions, `afterExecution` captures the result for further operations.

To demonstrate, take the following flow that uses both `finally` and `afterExecution`:

```yaml
id: state_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: run
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Execution RUNNING
  
  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

finally:
  - id: finally
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Execution RUNNING

afterExecution:
  - id: afterExecution 
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Execution FAILED
```

After executing the above, you can see that the `finally` task has a status of RUNNING while the `afterExecution` task says FAILED.
