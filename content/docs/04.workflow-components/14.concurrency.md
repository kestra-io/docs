Control concurrent executions of a given flow.

The flow level `concurrency` property allows you to control the number of concurrent executions of a given flow by setting the `limit` key.

You can treat concurrency as a global concurrency limit for that specific flow. The concurrency limit and behavior is then applied to all executions of that flow, regardless of whether those executions have been started automatically via a trigger, webhook, an API call or manually created from the UI.

For example, if you set the concurrency `limit` to 2, only two executions of that flow will be allowed to run at the same time. If you try to trigger a third execution, it will be queued until one of the two running executions is completed.

```yaml
id: concurrency_example
namespace: company.team

concurrency:
  limit: 2

tasks:
  - id: wait
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - sleep 10

```

As you can see in the UI, the third execution has been queued while the first two have finished successfully.

## `behavior` property

You can customize the execution behavior to CANCEL or FAIL an execution if the concurrency limit is reached. To do that, set the `behavior` Enum-type property to one of the following values:

- `QUEUE`
- `CANCEL`
- `FAIL`.

Let's say you set the `concurrency.limit` to 2, and you use the `CANCEL` or `FAIL` behavior. The third execution's state will be immediately set to `CANCELLED` or `FAILED` status respectively without running any task.

Here is a full flow example that uses the `concurrency` property to limit the number of concurrent executions to 2. The `bash` task will sleep for 10 seconds, so you can trigger multiple executions of that flow and see how the `concurrency` property behaves.

```yaml
id: concurrency_limited_flow
namespace: company.team

concurrency:
  behavior: FAIL # QUEUE, CANCEL or FAIL
  limit: 2 # can be any integer >= 1

tasks:
  - id: wait
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    commands:
      - sleep 10
```

As you can see in the UI, the third execution failed as the first two executions were still running.

## Tracking Concurrency Slots from the UI

The `Concurrency` tab in the `Flow` UI page allows you to track and troubleshoot concurrency issues. [This UI tab added in Kestra 0.19.0](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4721#event-14422957135) shows a progress bar with the number of active slots compared to the total number of slots available. Below that progress bar, you can see a table showing currently running and queued Executions, providing a clear overview of the flow's concurrency status.

![concurrency_page_1](/docs/workflow-components/concurrency/concurrency_page_1.png)

To see the concurrency behavior in action, you can configure a flow with a concurrency limit as follows:

```yaml
id: concurrent
namespace: company.team

concurrency:
  behavior: QUEUE
  limit: 5

tasks:
  - id: long_running_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - sleep 90
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
```

Then trigger multiple Executions of that flow and watch the `Concurrency` tab showing the active slots and queued Executions.

## How to Troubleshoot Concurrency Issues

Imagine that you encounter a situation where the concurrency limit is reached, and some executions are stuck in the `QUEUED` state. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

### Check the Concurrency Tab

The `Concurrency` tab on the `Flow` UI page described above allows you to see which executions are `RUNNING` and which are `QUEUED` (i.e. waiting or stuck). This page can help you troubleshoot which Executions are taking concurrency slots and which are waiting to be processed.

In the future, you'll be able to use this page to run any stuck Executions while ignoring concurrency limits (i.e., run them as if concurrency limits wouldn't exist).

### Edit the Concurrency Property

You can edit the `concurrency` property within the flow (or remove that property entirely to get rid of any limits) and `Save` the flow code. The modified concurrency limit and behavior will be immediately taken into account for all Executions in progress because the Executor checks this for the latest flow revision rather than for the revision of the Execution.

::alert{type="warning"}
Under any circumstances, do NOT delete the executions as this will only make the issue worse â€” the no longer existing (i.e. deleted) executions will keep occupying the concurrency slots forever. You can select stuck Executions and hit the `Kill` button to cancel them and free up the concurrency slots, but please don't delete them.
