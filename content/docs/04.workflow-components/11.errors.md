There are multiple ways to handle errors in Kestra, to both help you identify them and allow flows to continue to operate despite errors.

## `errors` Component

`errors` is a list of tasks set at the flow level that will be executed when an error occurs. You can add multiple tasks, and they will be executed sequentially. This is useful for sending alerts when errors occur.

The example below sends a flow-level failure alert via Slack using the [SlackIncomingWebhook](/plugins/plugin-notifications/tasks/slack/io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.slackincomingwebhook) task defined using the `errors` property.


```yaml file=public/examples/flows_errors_1.yaml
```

## `allowFailure` Property

When you execute a flow and one of its tasks fails, downstream tasks won't be executed. This may not always be desirable, especially for non-critical tasks. You can resolve this by adding the `allowFailure` property to the task, which will allow downstream tasks to continue despite the error. In this case, the execution will end in a `WARNING` state.

```yaml file=public/examples/flows_allow-failure.yml
```
