Execute your flows and view the outcome.

Execution is a single run of a flow in a specific state.

## Task Run

A task run is a single run of an individual task within an execution.

Each task run has associated data such as:
- Execution Id
- State
- Start Date
- End Date

## Attempts

Each task run can have one or more attempts. Most task runs will have only one attempt, but you can configure retries for a task.
If retries have been configured, a task failure will generate new attempts until the retry `maxAttempt` or `maxDuration` threshold is hit.

## Outputs

Each task can generate output data that other tasks of the current flow execution can use.

These outputs can be variables or files that will be stored inside Kestra's internal storage.

Outputs are described on each task documentation page and can be seen in the **Outputs** tab of the **Execution** page.

You can read more about Outputs on the [Outputs page](/docs/workflow-components/outputs).

## Metrics

Each task can expose metrics that may be useful in understanding the internals of a task. Metrics may include, for example, file size, number of returned rows, or query duration.

There are two kinds of metrics available: `Timer` and `Counter`.

Metrics can be seen in the **Metrics** tab of the **Executions** page.

## State

An Execution or a Task Run can be in a particular state.

There are nine possible states:

| State | Description |
| - | - |
| `CREATED` | The Execution or Task Run is waiting to be processed. This state usually means that the Execution is in a queue and is yet to be started. |
| `RUNNING` | The Execution or Task Run is currently running. |
| `PAUSED` | The Execution or Task Run has been paused. This status is used for two reasons: Manual validation and Delay (for a specified duration before continuing the execution). |
| `SUCCESS` | The Execution or Task Run has been completed successfully. |
| `WARNING` | The Execution or Task Run exhibited unintended behavior, but the execution continued and was flagged with a warning. |
| `FAILED` | The Execution or Task Run exhibited unintended behavior that caused the execution to fail. |
| `KILLING` | A command was issued that asked for the Execution or Task Run to be killed. The system is in the process of killing the associated tasks. |
| `KILLED` | An Execution or Task Run was killed (upon request), and no more tasks will run. |
| `RESTARTED` | This status is transitive. It is the same as `CREATED`, but for a flow that has already been executed, failed, and has been restarted. |

## Execute a flow from the UI

You can trigger a flow manually from the Kestra UI by clicking the `Execute` button on the flow's page. This is useful when you want to test a flow or run it on demand.

## Use automatic triggers

You can add a **Schedule trigger** to automatically launch a flow execution at a regular time interval.

Alternatively, you can add a **Flow trigger** to automatically launch a flow execution when another flow execution is completed. This pattern is particularly helpful when you want to:
- Implement a centralized namespace-level error handling strategy, e.g. to send a notification when any flow execution fails in a production namespace. Check the [Alerting & Monitoring](/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring) section for more details.
- Decouple your flows by following an event-driven pattern, in a backwards direction (_backwards because the flow is triggered by the completion of another flow; this is in contrast to the [subflow pattern](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.subflow), where a parent flow starts the execution of child flows and waits for the completion of each of them_).

Lastly, you can use the **Webhook trigger** to automatically launch a flow execution when a given HTTP request is received. You can leverage the `{{ trigger.body }}` variable to access the request body and the `{{ trigger.headers }}` variable to access the request headers in your flow.

To launch a flow and send data to the flow's execution context from an external system using a webhook, you can send a POST request to the Kestra API using the following URL: 
```bash
http://<kestra-host>:<kestra-port>/api/v1/executions/webhook/<namespace>/<flow-id>/<webhook-key>
``` 

Here is an example: 
```bash
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/webhook/dev/hello-world/secretWebhookKey42
```

You can also pass inputs to the flow using the `inputs` query parameter.

## Execute a flow via an API call

You can trigger a flow execution by calling the [API](/docs/api-reference) directly. This is useful when you want to start a flow execution from another application or service.

Let's use the following flow as example:

```yaml
id: hello-world
namespace: example

inputs:
  - id: greeting
    type: STRING
    defaults: hey

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: "{{ inputs.greeting }}"

triggers:
  - id: webhook
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Webhook
    key: test1234
```

Assuming that you run Kestra locally, you can trigger a flow execution by calling the ``/api/v1/executions/{namespace}/{flowId}`` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/dev/hello-world
```

The above command will trigger an execution of the latest revision of the `hello-world` flow from the `dev` namespace. If you want to trigger an execution for a specific revision, you can use the `revision` query parameter:

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/dev/hello-world?revision=2
```

You can also trigger a flow execution with inputs by adding the `inputs` as form data (the `-F` flag in the `curl` command):

```bash
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/dev/hello-world \
-F greeting="hey there"
```

## Webhook vs. API call

As you can see in the example above, when sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/executions/{namespace}/{flowId}` endpoint, you can only send data to the flow's execution context using `inputs`. This can be a little bit limiting if you want to send arbitrary metadata based on some event happening in your application. To send arbitrary metadata to the flow's execution context, you can leverage the webhook trigger.

Here is how you can adjust the above example to use the webhook trigger instead of an API call:

```yaml
id: hello-world
namespace: dev

inputs:
  - id: greeting
    type: STRING
    defaults: hey

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: "{{ trigger.body ?? inputs.greeting }}"

triggers:
  - id: webhook
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Webhook
    key: test1234
```

You can now send a POST request to the `/api/v1/executions/webhook/{namespace}/{flowId}/{webhookKey}` endpoint to trigger an execution and pass any metadata to the flow using the request body. In this example, the webhook URL would be `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/webhook/dev/hello-world/test1234`.

You can test the webhook trigger using a tool like Postman or cURL. Paste the webhook URL in the URL field and a [sample JSON payload](https://gist.github.com/anna-geller/df2532c0699e3ba4f572a88fbdf19a13) in the request body. Make sure to set:
- the request method to POST
- the request body type to raw and a JSON format.

Finally, click the Send button to trigger the flow execution. You should get a response with the execution ID and status code 200 OK.

⚡️ **When to use a webhook trigger vs. an API call to create an Execution?** To decide whether to use a webhook trigger or an API call to create an Execution, consider the following:
- Use the **webhook trigger** when you want **to send arbitrary metadata** to the flow's execution context based on some event happening in your application.
- Use the **webhook trigger** when you want to create new executions based on some **event** happening in an **external application**, such as a GitHub event (_e.g. a Pull Request is merged_) or a new record in a SaaS application, and you want to send the event metadata (header and body) to the flow to act on it.
- Use an **API call** to create an Execution when you **don't need to send any payload** (apart from `inputs`) to the flow's execution context.

## Execute a flow from Python

You can also launch a flow using the [kestra pip package](https://github.com/kestra-io/libs). This is useful when you want to trigger a flow execution from a Python application or service.

First, install the package:

```bash
pip install kestra
```

Then, you can trigger a flow execution by calling the `execute()` method. Here is an example for the same `hello-world` flow in the namespace `dev` as above:

```python
from kestra import Flow
flow = Flow()
flow.execute('dev', 'hello-world', {'greeting': 'hello from Python'})
```

Now imagine that you have a flow that takes a FILE-type input and reads the file's content:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: mynamespace

inputs:
  - id: myfile
    type: FILE

tasks:
  - id: print_data
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: "file's content {{ read(inputs.myfile) }}"
```

Assuming you have a file called `example.txt` in the same directory as your Python script, you can trigger the flow execution by passing the file as an input:

```python
import os
from kestra import Flow

os.environ["KESTRA_HOSTNAME"] = "http://host.docker.internal:8080" # # Set this when executing this Python code inside Kestra 

flow = Flow()
with open('example.txt', 'rb') as fh:
    flow.execute('mynamespace', 'myflow', {'files': ('myfile', fh, 'text/plain')})
```

Keep in mind that `files` is a tuple with the following structure: `('input_id', file_object, 'content_type')`.


## Execute with ForEachItem
The `ForEachItem` task allows you to iterate over a list of items and run a subflow for each item, or for each batch containing multiple items. This is useful when you want to process a large list of items in parallel, e.g. to process millions of records from a database table or an API payload.

The `ForEachItem` task is a **Flowable** task, which means that it can be used to define the flow logic and control the execution of the flow.

Syntax:

```yaml
  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ inputs.file }}" # could be also an output variable {{ outputs.extract.uri }}
    inputs:
      file: "{{ taskrun.items }}" # items of the batch
    batch:
      rows: 4
      bytes: 1024
      partitions: 2
    namespace: dev
    flowId: subflow
    revision: 1 # optional (default: latest)
    wait: true # wait for the subflow execution
    transmitFailed: true # fail the task run if the subflow execution fails
    labels: # optional labels to pass to the subflow to be executed
      key: value
```

::collapse{title="Full Example"}

Subflow:

```yaml
id: subflow
namespace: qa

inputs:
  - id: items
    type: STRING

tasks:
  - id: for_each_item
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - cat "{{ inputs.items }}"

  - id: read
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: "{{ read(inputs.items) }}"
```

Flow that uses the `ForEachItem` task to iterate over a list of items and run the `subflow` for a batch of 10 items at a time:

```yaml
id: each_parent
namespace: qa

tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    sql: |
      INSTALL httpfs;
      LOAD httpfs;
      SELECT *
      FROM read_csv_auto('https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv', header=True);
    store: true

  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"
    batch:
      rows: 10
    namespace: qa
    flowId: subflow
    wait: true
    transmitFailed: true
    inputs:
      items: "{{ taskrun.items }}"
```
