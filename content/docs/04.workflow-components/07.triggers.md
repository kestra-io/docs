Trigger is a mechanism that automates the execution of a flow. 

Triggers can be scheduled, event-based or webhook-based.

## Trigger types
Kestra supports both **scheduled** and **external** events.

Kestra core provides three types of triggers:

* [Schedule trigger](./schedule-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow on a regular cadence e.g. using a CRON expression and custom scheduling conditions
* [Flow trigger](./flow-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow when another flow finishes its execution (based on a configurable list of states)
* [Webhook trigger](./webhook-trigger.md) allows you to execute your flow based on an HTTP request emitted by a webhook.

Many other triggers are available from the plugins, such as triggers based on file detection events, e.g. the [S3 trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/triggers/s3/io.kestra.plugin.aws.s3.trigger), or a new message arrival in a message queue, such as the [SQS](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/triggers/sqs/io.kestra.plugin.aws.sqs.trigger) or [Kafka trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-kafka/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.kafka.trigger).


### Trigger Common Properties

Following trigger properties can be set.

| Field | Description                                                         |
| ----- |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`id`| The flow identifier, must be unique inside a flow.                  |
|`type`| The Java FQDN of the trigger.                                       |
|`description`| The description of the trigger.                                     |
|`disabled`| Set it to `true` to disable execution of the trigger.               |
|`workerGroup.key`| To execute this trigger on a specific Worker Group (EE) |

## Trigger Variables

Triggers allow you to access trigger metadata through expressions e.g. `{{ trigger.date }}` to access the current date of the [Schedule trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.schedule), `{{ trigger.uri }}` to access the file or message from any file detection or message arrival event, as well as `{{ trigger.rows }}` for all Query triggers e.g. the [PostgreSQL Query](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-jdbc-postgres/triggers/io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.trigger) trigger.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that the above-mentioned **templated variables** are only available when the execution is created **automatically** by the trigger. You'll get an error if you try to run a flow containing such variables **manually**.

Also, note that **you don't need an extra task to consume** the file or message from the event. Kestra downloads those automatically to the **internal storage** and makes those available in your flow using `{{ trigger.uri }}` variable. Therefore, you don't need any additional task to e.g. consume a message from the SQS queue or to download a file from S3 when using those event triggers. The trigger already consumes and downloads those, making them directly available for further processing. Check the documentation of a specific trigger and [Blueprints](https://kestra.io/blueprints) with the **Trigger** tag for more details and examples.
::

Triggers restrict parallel execution for a given trigger ID to one active run. For instance, if an Execution from a flow with a `Schedule` trigger with ID `hourly` is still in a `Running` state, another one will not be started. However, you can still trigger the same flow manually (from the UI or API), and the scheduled Executions will not be affected.

```yaml
id: hourlyFlow
namespace: example
tasks:
  - id: important-task
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: If this runs for longer than 1h, next Executions will be queued rather than being started immediately
triggers:
  - id: hourly
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "@hourly"
```

## Conditions

Conditions are specific criteria or events that determine when a specific triggers should create a new execution. Usually, they limit the scope of a trigger to a specific set of cases.

For example, you can restrict a Flow trigger to a specific namespace prefix or execution status, and you can restrict a Schedule trigger to a specific time of the week or month.

You can pass a list of conditions; in this case, all the conditions must match to enable the current action.

Available conditions include:

- [ExecutionFlowCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.executionflowcondition)
- [ExecutionNamespaceCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.executionnamespacecondition)
- [ExecutionStatusCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.executionstatuscondition)
- [FlowCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.flowcondition)
- [FlowNamespaceCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.flownamespacecondition)
- [VariableCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.variablecondition)


## Schedule Trigger

The Schedule trigger generates new executions on a regular cadence based on a Cron expression or custom scheduling conditions.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule"
```

Kestra is able to trigger flows based on a Schedule (aka the time). If you need to wait for another system to be ready and cannot use any event mechanism, you can schedule one or more time the current flow.

Kestra will optionally handle schedule [backfills](/docs/concepts/backfill) if any executions are missed. 

Check the [Schedule task](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.schedule) documentation for the list of the task properties and outputs.


::collapse{title="Example"}

> A schedule that runs every quarter of an hour.

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
```

> A schedule that runs only the first monday of every month at 11 AM.
>
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "0 11 * * 1"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.DayWeekInMonthCondition
        date: "{{ trigger.date }}"
        dayOfWeek: "MONDAY"
        dayInMonth: "FIRST"
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Schedules **cannot overlap**. This means that we **cannot have any concurrent schedules**. If the previous schedule is not ended when the next one must start, the scheduler will wait until the end of the previous one. The same applies during backfills.
::

::alert{type="info"}
Most of the time, schedule execution will depend on the `trigger.date` (looking at files for today, SQL query with the schedule date in the where clause, ...). This works well but prevents you from executing your flow manually (since these variables are only available during the schedule).

You can use this expression to make your **manual execution work**: `{{ trigger.date ?? execution.startDate | date("yyyy-MM-dd") }}`. It will use the current date if there is no schedule date making it possible to start the flow manually.
::
::

### Schedule Conditions

When the `cron` is not sufficient to determine the date you want to schedule your flow, you can use `conditions` to add additional conditions, (for example, only the first day of the month, only the weekend, ...).

You **must** use the `{{ trigger.date }}` expression on the property `date` of the current schedule.

This condition will be evaluated and `{{ trigger.previous }}` and `{{ trigger.next }}` will reflect the date **with** the conditions applied.

The list of core conditions that can be used are:

 - [DateTimeBetweenCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.datetimebetweencondition)
 - [DayWeekCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.dayweekcondition)
 - [DayWeekInMonthCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.dayweekinmonthcondition)
 - [NotCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.notcondition)
 - [OrCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.orcondition)
 - [WeekendCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.weekendcondition)
 - [DayWeekInMonthCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.dayweekinmonthcondition)

### Recover Missed Schedules

If a schedule is missed, Kestra will automatically recover it by default. This means that if the Kestra server is down, the missed schedules will be executed as soon as the server is back up. However, this behavior is not always desirable, e.g. during a planned maintenance window. In Kestra 0.15 and higher, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration to `NONE`.

Kestra 0.15 introduced a new configuration allowing you to choose whether you want to recover missed schedules or not:

```yaml
kestra:
  plugins:
    configurations:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
        values:
          # available options: LAST | NONE | ALL -- default: ALL
          recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

The `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration can be set to `ALL`, `NONE` or `LAST`:
- `ALL`: Kestra will recover all missed schedules. This is the **default** value.
- `NONE`: Kestra will not recover any missed schedules.
- `LAST`: Kestra will recover only the last missed schedule for each flow.

Note that this is a global configuration that will apply to all flows, unless other behavior is explicitly defined within the flow definition:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "*/15 * * * *"
    recoverMissedSchedules: NONE
```

In this example, the `recoverMissedSchedules` is set to `NONE`, which means that Kestra will not recover any missed schedules for this specific flow regardless of the global configuration.


## Flow Trigger

Flow triggers allows you to trigger a flow after another flow execution, enabling event-driven patterns.

```yaml
type: "io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow"
```

Kestra is able to trigger one flow after another one. This allows the chaining of flows without the need to update the base flows. With this capacity, you can break responsibility between different flows to different teams.

Check the [Flow trigger](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.flow) documentation for the list of all properties.

::collapse{title="Example"}

This flow will be triggered after each successful execution of the flow `io.kestra.tests.trigger-flow` and forward the `uri` output of the `my-task` task.
```yaml
id: trigger-flow-listener
namespace: io.kestra.tests
revision: 1

inputs:
  - id: fromParent
    type: STRING

tasks:
  - id: onlyNoInput
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "v1: {{trigger.executionId}}"

triggers:
  - id: listenFlow
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    inputs:
      fromParent: '{{ outputs.myTask.uri }}'
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
        namespace: io.kestra.tests
        flowId: trigger-flow
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionStatusCondition
        in:
          - SUCCESS
```

> This flow will be triggered after the successful execution of both flows `flow-a` and `flow-b` during the current day. When the conditions are met, the counter is reset and can be re-triggered during the same day. See [MultipleCondition](/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.multiplecondition) for more details
```yaml
id: trigger-multiplecondition-listener
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
  - id: onlyListener
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "let's go "

triggers:
  - id: multipleListenFlow
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    conditions:
      - id: multiple
        type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.MultipleCondition
        window: P1D
        windowAdvance: P0D
        conditions:
          flow-a:
            type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
            namespace: io.kestra.tests
            flowId: trigger-multiplecondition-flow-a
          flow-b:
            type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
            namespace: io.kestra.tests
            flowId: trigger-multiplecondition-flow-b

```

## Webhook Trigger

Webhook triggers generates a unique URL that you can use to automatically create new executions based on events in another application such as GitHub or Amazon EventBridge.

In order to use that URL, you have to add a secret `key` that will secure your webhook URL.


```yaml
type: "io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Webhook"
```

A Webhook trigger allows triggering a flow from a webhook URL.
At trigger creation a key must be set that will be used on the URL that triggers the flow: `/api/v1/executions/webhook/{namespace}/{flowId}/{key}`. We advise to use a non-easy to find or remember key like a generated sequence of characters. Kestra accepts `GET`, `POST` and `PUT` requests on this URL The whole request body and headers will be available as variables.

::collapse{title="Example"}
> Add a trigger to the current flow:
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: webhook
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Webhook
    key: 4wjtkzwVGBM9yKnjm3yv8r
```
> After the trigger is created, the key must be explicitly set in the webhook URL. You can launch the flow using the following URL
 `/api/v1/executions/webhook/{namespace}/{flowId}/4wjtkzwVGBM9yKnjm3yv8r`.
::

Check the [Webhook task](/plugins/core/triggers/io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.webhook) documentation for the list of the task properties and outputs.

## Polling Triggers

Polling triggers are a type of triggers that are provided by our plugins. They allow polling an external system for the presence of data. In case data is ready to be processed, a flow execution is started.

Kestra provides polling triggers for a wide variety of external systems: databases, message brokers, ftp, ...

Polling triggers will poll the external system at a fixed interval defined by the `interval` property, the triggered flow will have the outputs of the polling trigger available on the `trigger` variable.

::collapse{title="Example"}
For example, the following flow will be triggered when rows are available on the `my_table` PostgreSQL table, and when triggered, it will delete the rows (to avoid processing them again on the next poll) and log them.

```yaml
id: jdbc-trigger
namespace: io.kestra.tests

tasks:
- id: update
  type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Query
  sql: DELETE * FROM my_table
- id: log
  type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
  message: {{trigger.rows}}

triggers:
  - id: watch
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Trigger
    interval: "PT5M"
    sql: "SELECT * FROM my_table"
```
::

Polling triggers can be evaluated on a specific Worker Group (EE), thanks to the `workerGroup.key` property.

## Unlocking, enabling and disabling triggers

### Disabling a trigger in the source code
If you want to temporarily disable a trigger, you could do so by setting the `disabled` property to `true`, as you can see in the example below:

```yaml
id: hello_world
namespace: example

tasks:
  - id: sleep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - sleep 30

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    disabled: true
```

However, this approach requires changing the source code. A better approach is to use the `Enabled` toggle from the UI.

### Disabling a trigger from the UI

You can disable or re-enable a trigger from the UI. Here is how you can do it:
1. Go to the `Flows` page and click on the flow you want to disable the trigger for.
2. Go to the `Triggers` tab and click on the `Enabled` toggle next to the trigger you want to disable. You can re-enable it by clicking the toggle again.

![triggers_flow](/docs/workflow-components/triggers_flow.png)

If your trigger is locked due to an execution in progress, you can unlock it by clicking the `Unlock trigger` button.

![trigger_unlock](/docs/workflow-components/trigger_unlock.png)

The **Unlock trigger** functionality is useful for troubleshooting, e.g. if a process is stuck due to infrastructure issues. Note that manually unlocking triggers may result in multiple concurrent (potentially duplicated) executions — use it with caution.

### Toggle or unlock triggers from the Administation page

You can also disable, re-enable, or unlock triggers from the Administration page. Here is how you can do it:

![triggers_administration](/docs/workflow-components/triggers_administration.png)


## The ``stopAfter`` property

Kestra 0.15 introduced a generic `stopAfter` property which is a list of states that will disable the trigger after the flow execution has reached one of the states in the list.

This property is meant to be used primarily for a `Schedule` trigger and triggers that poll for conditions including the HTTP, JDBC, or File Detection triggers. However, you can use it with all triggers.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that we don't handle any automatic trigger reenabling logic. After a trigger has been disabled due to the `stopAfter` state condition, you can take some action based on it and manually reenable the trigger.
::


### Pause the schedule trigger after a failed execution

The `stopAfter` property can be used to pause a schedule trigger after a failed execution. Here is an example of how to use it:

```yaml
id: business_critical_flow
namespace: production

tasks:
 - id: important_task
   type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
   message: if this fails, we want to stop the flow from running until we fix it

triggers:
 - id: stopAfter
   type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
   cron: "0 9 * * *"
   stopAfter:
     - FAILED
```

The above flow will be triggered every day at 9:00 AM, but if it fails, the schedule will be paused so that you can manually reenable the trigger once the issue is fixed. This is useful for business-critical flows that should not continue running the next scheduled executions if a previous execution has failed.

### Disable the HTTP trigger after the first successful execution

The example below shows how to use the `stopAfter` property with the HTTP trigger condition. The use case is to poll an API endpoint and send a Slack alert if the price is below $110. If the condition is met, the trigger will be disabled so that you don't get alerted every 30 seconds about the same condition.

```yaml
id: http
namespace: example

tasks:
  - id: slack
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK') }}"
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#price-alerts",
        "text": "The price is now: {{ json(trigger.body).price }}"
      }

triggers:
  - id: http
    type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.Trigger
    uri: https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1
    responseCondition: "{{ json(response.body).price <= 110 }}"
    interval: PT30S
    stopAfter:
      - SUCCESS
```

Let's break down the above example:
1. The HTTP trigger will poll the API endpoint every 30 seconds to check if the price of a product is below $110.
2. If the condition is met, the Execution will be created
3. Within that execution, the `slack` task will send a Slack message to the `#price-alerts` channel to notify about the price change
4. After that execution finishes successfully, the `stopAfter` property condition is met — it will disable the trigger ensuring that you don't get alerted every 30 seconds about the same condition.
