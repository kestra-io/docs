Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest server local
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flow.

The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with PostgreSQL and more configurability, follow the [Docker Compose installation](./03.docker-compose.md).

## Configuration

### Using a configuration file

You can adjust Kestra's configuration using a file passed to the Docker container as a bind volume.

First, create a configuration file, for example, in a file named `application.yaml`:
```yaml
datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/kestra
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: kestra
    password: k3str4
kestra:
  server:
    basicAuth:
      enabled: false
      username: "admin@kestra.io" # it must be a valid email address
      password: kestra
  repository:
    type: postgres
  storage:
    type: local
    local:
      basePath: "/app/storage"
  queue:
    type: postgres
  tasks:
    tmpDir:
      path: "/tmp/kestra-wd/tmp"
  url: "http://localhost:8080/"
```

::alert{type="info"}
Note: this configuration is taken from our official [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml#L33) file and uses a PostgreSQL database, you may want to retrieve it there to be sure it is accurate.
::

Then, change the command to mount the file to the container and start Kestra with the configuration file; we also adjust the Kestra command to start a standalone version as we now have a PostgreSQL database as a backend.

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root \
 -v $PWD/application.yaml:/etc/config/application.yaml \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest server standalone --config /etc/config/application.yaml
```

### Using the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable

You can adjust the Kestra configuration with a `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` passed to the Docker container via the `-e` options.
This environment variable must be a valid YAML string.

Managing a large configuration via a single YAML string can be tedious. To make that easier, you can leverage a configuration file.

First, define an environment variable:

```bash
export KESTRA_CONFIGURATION="datasources:
          postgres:
            url: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/kestra
            driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
            username: kestra
            password: k3str4
        kestra:
          server:
            basicAuth:
              enabled: false
              username: "admin@kestra.io" # it must be a valid email address
              password: kestra
          repository:
            type: postgres
          storage:
            type: local
            local:
              basePath: "/app/storage"
          queue:
            type: postgres
          tasks:
            tmpDir:
              path: /tmp/kestra-wd/tmp
          url: http://localhost:8080/
```

::alert{type="info"}
Note: this configuration is taken from our official [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml#L33) file and uses a PostgreSQL database, you may want to retrieve it there to be sure it is accurate.
::

Then pass this environment variable in the Docker command and adjust the Kestra command to run the standalone server:

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root \
 -e KESTRA_CONFIGURATION=$KESTRA_CONFIGURATION
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest server standalone
```


## Official Docker images

The official Kestra Docker images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra) for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.

We provide two image variants:
- `kestra/kestra:*`
- `kestra/kestra:*-no-plugins`

Both variants are based on the [`eclipse-temurin:21-jre`](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) Docker image.

The `kestra/kestra:*` images contain all Kestra [plugins](/plugins) in their **latest version**. The `kestra/kestra:*-no-plugins` images do not contain any plugins. We recommend using the `kestra/kestra:*` version.

## Docker image tags

We provide the following tags for each Docker image:

- `latest`: the default image with the latest stable release, including all plugins.
- `latest-no-plugins`: the default image with the latest stable release, excluding all plugins.
- `v<release-version>`: image for a specific Kestra release, including all plugins.
- `v<release-version>-no-plugins`: image for a specific Kestra release, excluding all plugins.
- `develop`: an image based on the `develop` branch that changes daily and contains **unstable** features we are working on, including all plugins.
- `develop-no-plugins`: an image based on the `develop` branch that changes daily and contains **unstable** features we are working on, excluding all plugins.

The **default Kestra image** `kestra/kestra:latest` already includes **all plugins**. To use a lightweight version of Kestra without plugins, add a suffix `*-no-plugins`.

### Recommended images for production

We recommend using the `latest` image for production deployments. This image includes the latest stable release and optionally also all plugins:
- `kestra/kestra:latest` — contains the latest stable version of Kestra and all plugins
- `kestra/kestra:latest-no-plugins` — contains the latest stable version of Kestra without any plugins.

If your deployment strategy is to pin the version, make sure to change the image as follows (_here, based on the `v0.18.0` release_):
- `kestra/kestra:v0.18.0` if you want to have all plugins included in the image
- `kestra/kestra:v0.18.0-no-plugins` if you prefer to use only your custom plugins.

### Recommended images for development

The most recently developed (but not yet released) features and bug fixes are included in the `develop` image. This image is updated daily and contains the latest changes from the `develop` branch:
- `kestra/kestra:develop` if you want to have all plugins included in the image
- `kestra/kestra:develop-no-plugins` if you prefer to use only your custom plugins.

## Build a custom Docker image

If the base or full image doesn't contain package dependencies you need, you can build a custom image by using the Kestra base image and adding the required binaries and dependencies.

### Add custom binaries


The following `Dockerfile` creates an image from the Kestra base image and adds the `golang` binary and Python packages:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest
FROM kestra/kestra:$IMAGE_TAG

RUN mkdir -p /app/plugins && \
  apt-get update -y && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends golang && \
  apt-get install -y pip && \
  pip install pandas==2.0.3 requests==2.31.0 && \
  apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/tmp/*
```

### Add plugins to a Docker image

By default, the base Docker image `kestra/kestra:latest` contains all plugins (unless you use the `kestra/kestra:latest-no-plugins` version). You can add specific plugins to the base image and build a custom image.

The following example `Dockerfile` creates an image from the base image and adds the `plugin-notifications`, `storage-gcs` and `plugin-gcp` binaries using the command `kestra plugins install`:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest-no-plugins
FROM kestra/kestra:$IMAGE_TAG

RUN /app/kestra plugins install \
  io.kestra.plugin:plugin-notifications:LATEST \
  io.kestra.storage:storage-gcs:LATEST \
  io.kestra.plugin:plugin-gcp:LATEST
```

### Add custom plugins to a Docker image

The above example `Dockerfile` installs plugins that have already been published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/). If you are developing a custom plugin, make sure to [build it](../plugin-developer-guide/index.md). Once the `shadowJar` is built, add it to the plugins directory:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest
FROM kestra/kestra:$IMAGE_TAG

RUN mkdir -p /app/plugins

COPY /build/libs/*.jar /app/plugins
```

### Add custom plugins from a Git repository

If you would like to build custom plugins from a specific Git repository, you can use the following approach:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-slim as stage-build
WORKDIR /
USER root

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install git -y && \
    git clone https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws.git

RUN cd plugin-aws && ./gradlew :shadowJar

FROM kestra/kestra:latest

# https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker/issues/194#issuecomment-433519379
USER root

RUN mkdir -p /app/plugins && \
  apt-get update -y && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends golang && \
  apt-get install -y pip && \
  pip install pandas==2.0.3 requests==2.31.0 && \
  apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/tmp/*

RUN rm -rf /app/plugins/plugin-aws-*.jar
COPY --from=stage-build /plugin-aws/build/libs/plugin-aws-*.jar /app/plugins
```

This multi-stage Docker build allows you to overwrite a plugin that has already been installed. In this example, the AWS plugin is by default already included in the `kestra/kestra:latest` image. However, it's overwritten by a plugin built in the first Docker build stage.
