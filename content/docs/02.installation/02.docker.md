Start Kestra in a single Docker container.


Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest-full server local
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flows.

::alert{type="info"}
The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with Postgres and more configurability, follow the [Docker Compose installation](../02.installation/12.docker-compose.md).

## Official Docker images

The official Kestra Docker images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra) for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.

We provide two image variants:
- `kestra/kestra:*`
- `kestra/kestra:*-full`

Both variants are based on the [`eclipse-temurin:17-jre`](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) Docker image.

The `kestra/kestra:*-full` images contain all Kestra [plugins](/plugins) in their **latest version**. The `kestra/kestra:*` images do not contain any plugins.

## Docker image tags

We provide the following tags for each Docker image:

- `latest`: the default image with the latest stable release along with its full variant `latest-full`.
- `v<release-version>`: image for a specific Kestra release with its full variant `v<release-version>-full`.
- `release`: the preview image of the next release along with its full variant `release-full`.
- `develop`: an image based on the `develop` branch that changes daily and contains **unstable** features we are working on; the full variant is also available `develop-full`.
