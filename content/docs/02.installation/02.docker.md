Start Kestra in a single Docker container.


Make sure that Docker is running. Then, you can start Kestra in a single command using Docker (*if you run it on Windows, make sure to use [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)*):

```bash
docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest-full server local
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to launch the UI and start building your first flows.

::alert{type="info"}
The above command starts Kestra with an embedded H2 database. If you want to use a persistent database backend with Postgres and more configurability, follow the [Docker Compose installation](../02.installation/12.docker-compose.md).

## Official Docker images

The official Kestra Docker images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kestra/kestra) for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.

We provide two image variants:
- `kestra/kestra:*`
- `kestra/kestra:*-full`

Both variants are based on the [`eclipse-temurin:17-jre`](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) Docker image.

The `kestra/kestra:*-full` images contain all Kestra [plugins](/plugins) in their **latest version**. The `kestra/kestra:*` images do not contain any plugins.

## Docker image tags

We provide the following tags for each Docker image:

- `latest`: the default image with the latest stable release along with its full variant `latest-full`.
- `v<release-version>`: image for a specific Kestra release with its full variant `v<release-version>-full`.
- `release`: the preview image of the next release along with its full variant `release-full`.
- `develop`: an image based on the `develop` branch that changes daily and contains **unstable** features we are working on; the full variant is also available `develop-full`.


### Build a Docker image with custom binaries

If the base or full image doesn't contain package dependencies you need, you can build a custom image by using the Kestra base image and adding the needed binaries.

The following `Dockerfile` creates an image from the Kestra base image and adds the `golang` binary and Python packages:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest
FROM kestra/kestra:$IMAGE_TAG

RUN mkdir -p /app/plugins && \
  apt-get update -y && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends golang && \
  apt-get install -y pip && \
  pip install pandas==2.0.3 requests==2.31.0 && \
  apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/tmp/*
```

### Add plugins to a Docker image

By default, the base Docker image `kestra/kestra:latest` does not contain any plugins (unless you use the `kestra/kestra:latest-full` version). You can add the needed plugins to the base image and build a custom image.

The following `Dockerfile` creates an image from the base image and adds the `plugin-notifications`, `storage-gcs` and `plugin-gcp` binaries using the command `kestra plugins install`:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest
FROM kestra/kestra:$IMAGE_TAG

RUN /app/kestra plugins install \
  io.kestra.plugin:plugin-notifications:LATEST \
  io.kestra.storage:storage-gcs:LATEST \
  io.kestra.plugin:plugin-gcp:LATEST
```

### Add custom plugins to a Docker image

The above Dockerfile installs plugins that have already been published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/). If you would like to build custom plugins from a specific Git repository, you can use the following approach:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-slim as stage-build
WORKDIR /
USER root

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install git -y && \
    git clone https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws.git

RUN cd plugin-aws && ./gradlew :shadowJar

FROM kestra/kestra:latest-full

# https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker/issues/194#issuecomment-433519379
USER root

RUN mkdir -p /app/plugins && \
  apt-get update -y && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends golang && \
  apt-get install -y pip && \
  pip install pandas==2.0.3 requests==2.31.0 && \
  apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/tmp/*

RUN rm -rf /app/plugins/plugin-aws-*.jar
COPY --from=stage-build /plugin-aws/build/libs/plugin-aws-*.jar /app/plugins
```

This multi-stage Docker build allows you to overwrite a plugin that has already been installed. In this example, the AWS plugin is by default already included in the `kestra/kestra:latest-full` image. However, it's overwritten by a plugin built in the first Docker build stage.
