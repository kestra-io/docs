Install Kestra on a standalone server with a simple executable file.

## Overview
To deploy Kestra without Docker, we provide a standalone JAR that allows deployment in any environment that has JVM version 17+.

The latest JAR can be downloaded [via Kestra API](https://api.kestra.io/v1/versions/download).

This is an executable JAR:
- For Linux & MacOS, run it with `./kestra-VERSION <command>`.
- For Windows, rename the file `./kestra-VERSION` to `./kestra-VERSION.bat`, and run it from `CMD`.

For example, to launch Kestra:
- in local mode (with an H2 local file database), you will run `./kestra-VERSION server local`.
- in standalone mode (you need to provide a configurion with a connection to a database) , you will run `./kestra-VERSION server standalone`.

::alert{type="warning"}
Running the jar version will come without any [plugins](https://kestra.io/plugins). You need to install them manually with the ``kestra plugins install
directory_with_plugins/`` command. Alternatively, point to a directory with plugins in the configuration file or an an environment variable `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH` e.g. `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH=/Users/anna/dev/plugins`.

## Configuration

You can either put your whole configuration in the environment variable `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` or you can specify a configuration file to read through `--config` (or `-c`) option. If neither of these option is used, Kestra will read from `${HOME}/.kestra/config.yml`.

If you are using `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable, you'll need to have a directory called `confs` in the directory where you run Kestra.

Configuration options are available [in the Administrator Guide](../10.administrator-guide/index.md), you can also see the default configuration available on  [GitHub](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/cli/src/main/resources/application.yml).
