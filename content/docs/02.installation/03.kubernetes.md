## Helm Chart repository

For production workloads, we recommend using [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) for deployment, as it enables scaling of specific Kestra services as needed. Before getting started, make sure that you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed. Refer to their documentation if needed.

We provide an official [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) to make the deployment easier.

- The chart repository is available under [helm.kestra.io](https://helm.kestra.io/).
- The source code of the charts can be found in the [kestra-io/helm-charts](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts) repository on GitHub. There are three charts:

1. `kestra`: this is the production chart with no dependencies installed.
2. `kestra-starter`: this chart comes with dependencies such as PostgreSQL and MinIO that are maintained by the user -- not recommended for production installations.
3. `kestra-operator`: this is a separate chart for installing the operator.

::alert{type="info"}
All image tags provided by default can be found in the [Docker installation guide](./02.docker.md).
::

## Install the chart

```bash
helm repo add kestra https://helm.kestra.io/
helm install my-kestra kestra/kestra
```

You'll now see a pod has been started:
- Standalone: All components of Kestra deployed together in one pod

If using `kestra-starter`, then there'll be three additional pods:
- PostgreSQL: Database service
- MinIO: Internal storage backend

To access, export the pod name as an environment variable with the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade my-kestra kestra/kestra -f values.yaml
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=kestra,app.kubernetes.io/instance=kestra,app.kubernetes.io/component=standalone" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```
To then access from localhost, run the following `port-forward` command with kubectl:

```bash
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080
```

## Scale Kestra with Kubernetes

By default, the chart deploys only one standalone Kestra [service](../07.architecture/index.md) with one replica within a single pod. However, to increase scalability and flexibility, you can also configure the Kestra components to run in their own dedicated, standalone pods. Use the following [Helm chart values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/chart_kestra/charts/kestra/values.yaml) to change that default behavior and deploy each service independently in their own pod:

To deploy each service independently in its own pod, add the values you want from the [Helm chart values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/chart_kestra/charts/kestra/values.yaml) into a `values.yaml` file in your instance's configuration like below:

```yaml
deployments:
  webserver:
    enabled: true
  executor:
    enabled: true
  indexer:
    enabled: true
  scheduler:
    enabled: true
  worker:
    enabled: true
  standalone:
    enabled: false
```

The above configuration enables a standalone pod for each Kestra component (webserver, executor, indexer, etc.) and disables the combined, standalone pod. This offers more scalable, granular resource allocation of each component depending on workflow demand and how intensely each component is utilized.

To confirm these changes and re-deploy, save the `values.yaml` and upgrade your Helm charts with the same commands as before:

```bash
helm upgrade my-kestra kestra/kestra -f values.yaml
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=kestra,app.kubernetes.io/instance=kestra,app.kubernetes.io/component=standalone" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080
```

Now you are able to access Kestra at `localhost:8080`. Since Kestra 1.0, this chart doesn't include any external dependencies (like MinIO and Postgres), so make sure to configure your instance as needed.

The `kestra-starter` chart deploys the following related services in Kestra (intended as a starter installation):
- A MinIO standalone server
- A PostgreSQL database

::alert{type="warning"}
All external services in `kestra-starter` (MinIO and PostgreSQL) are provided as-is and require proper configuration for production use. These services need to be fine-tuned according to your specific requirements, including resource allocation, security settings, and high availability configurations. We recommend the `kestra` chart for production installations.

**Note:** PostgreSQL is configured to use a low amount of resources by default but it can be reconfigured as needed.

## Secret environment variables

You can use secrets by adding them to your `configurations` in the `values.yaml` file. 

```yaml
configurations:
  application:
    kestra:
      queue:
        type: h2
      repository:
        type: h2
      storage:
        type: local
        local:
          basePath: "/app/storage"
    datasources:
      h2:
        url: jdbc:h2:mem:public;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
        username: kestra
        password: ""
        driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
  configmaps:
    - name: kestra-others
      key: others.yml
  secrets:
    - name: kestra-basic-auth
      key: basic-auth.yml
```
If you need to add extra environment variables from existing `ConfigMaps` or `Secrets`, you can use `extraEnv` and `extraEnvFrom` under the common entry.

```yaml
common:
  nodeSelector: {}
  tolerations: []
  affinity: {}
  extraVolumeMounts: []
  extraVolumes: []
  extraEnv: []
  # more...
```

The `extraEnvFrom` property enables you to access the variables as secrets in your Kestra instance. For example, you could add the following to your configuration for basic authentication access:

```yaml
common:
  extraEnvFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: basic-auth-secret
```

The `extraEnvFrom` property then points to:

```yaml
extraManifests:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: basic-auth-secret
    stringData:
      basic-auth.yml: |
        kestra:
          server:
            basicAuth:
              enabled: true
              username: admin@localhost.com
              password: ChangeMe1234!
```
There are multiple ways to configure and access secrets in a Kubernetes installation. Use whichever method fits your environment.

## Configuration

There are two methods to adjust the Kestra configuration:
- Using a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` via the `configurations` Helm value
- Using a Kubernetes `Secret` via the `secrets` Helm value

Both must be valid YAML that is merged as the Kestra configuration file.

Below is an example that shows how to enable Kafka as the queue implementation and configure its server property using a secret:

```yaml
configurations:
  application:
    kestra:
      queue:
        type: kafka

  secrets:
    - name: kafka-server
      key: kafka.yml
```

The Kafka secret key then points towards a secret in `extraManifests`:

```yaml
extraManifests:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: kafka-server
    stringData:
      kafka.yml: |
        kestra:
          kafka:
            client:
              properties:
                bootstrap.servers: "localhost:9092"
```

There are multiple ways to configure and access secrets in a Kubernetes installation. Use whichever method fits your environment.

## Docker in Docker (DinD) Worker side car

By default, Docker in Docker (DinD) is installed on the worker in the rootless version.
This can be restricted on some environments due to security limitations.

Some solutions you may try:
- On Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), use a node pool based on `UBUNTU_CONTAINERD` that works well with Docker DinD, even rootless.
- Some Kubernetes clusters only support a root version of DinD; to make your Kestra deployment work, [disable the rootless version](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/chart_kestra/charts/kestra/README.md#kestra-dind-rootless) using the following Helm chart values:

```yaml
dind:
  image:
    repository: docker
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    tag: dind
  args:
    - --log-level=fatal
```

## Docker in Docker (DinD)

If you encounter issues using Docker in Docker (e.g., with [Script tasks](../16.scripts/index.md) using `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker` Task Runner), start troubleshooting by attaching the terminal: ``docker run -it --privileged docker:dind sh``. Next, use `docker logs container_ID` to get the container logs. Also, try `docker inspect container_ID` to get more information about your Docker container. The output from this command displays details about the container, its environments, network settings, etc. This information can help you identify what might be wrong.

### Docker in Docker using Helm charts

On some Kubernetes deployments, using DinD with our default Helm charts can lead to errors like below:

```bash
Device "ip_tables" does not exist.
ip_tables              24576  4 iptable_raw,iptable_mangle,iptable_nat,iptable_filter
modprobe: can't change directory to '/lib/modules': No such file or directory
error: attempting to run rootless dockerd but need 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone' (/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone) set to 1
```

The example below shows `dind` configuration properties and how to use the [insecure mode](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/chart_kestra/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L257) for DinD:

```yaml
dind:
  # -- Enable Docker-in-Docker (dind) sidecar.
  # @section -- kestra dind
  enabled: true
  # -- Dind mode (rootless or insecure).
  # @section -- kestra dind
  mode: 'rootless'
  base:
    # -- Rootless dind configuration.
    # @section -- kestra dind rootless
    rootless:
      image:
        repository: docker
        pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        tag: dind-rootless
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
      args:
        - --log-level=fatal
        - --group=1000
    # -- Insecure dind configuration (privileged).
    # @section -- kestra dind insecure
    insecure:
      image:
        repository: docker
        pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        tag: dind-rootless
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
        runAsUser: 0
        runAsGroup: 0
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
        capabilities:
          add:
            - SYS_ADMIN
            - NET_ADMIN
            - DAC_OVERRIDE
            - SETUID
            - SETGID
      args:
        - '--log-level=fatal'
```

### Disable Docker in Docker and use Kubernetes task runner

To avoid using `root` to spin up containers via DinD, disable DinD by setting the following [Helm chart values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/chart_kestra/charts/kestra/README.md#kestra-dind):

```yaml
dind:
  enabled: false
```

Use the Kubernetes task runner as the default method for running [script tasks](../16.scripts/index.md):

```yaml
pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts
    forced: true
    values:
      taskRunner:
        type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.kubernetes.runner.Kubernetes
        # ... your Kubernetes runner configuration
```
