Install Kestra in a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart.


## Helm Chart repository

We recommend [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) deployment for **production** workloads, as it allows you to scale specific Kestra services as needed.

We provide an official [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) to make the deployment easier.

- The chart repository is available under [helm.kestra.io](https://helm.kestra.io/).
- The source code of the charts can be found in the [kestra-io/helm-charts](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts) repository on GitHub.

::alert{type="info"}
All image tags provided by default can be found in the [Docker installation guide](./02.docker.md).
::

## Install the chart

```bash
helm repo add kestra https://helm.kestra.io/
helm install kestra kestra/kestra
```

By default, the chart will only deploy one standalone Kestra [service](/docs/architecture) with one replica. This means that all Kestra server components will be deployed within a single pod. You can change that default behavior and deploy each service independently using the following [Helm chart values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/kestra/values.yaml):

```yaml
deployments:
  webserver:
    enabled: true
  executor:
    enabled: true
  indexer:
    enabled: true
  scheduler:
    enabled: true
  worker:
    enabled: true
  standalone:
    enabled: false
```

The chart can also deploy the following related services:
- A Kafka cluster and Zookeeper using `kafka.enabled: true`
- An Elasticsearch cluster using `elasticsearch.enabled: true`
- A MinIO standalone using `minio.enabled: true`
- A PostgreSQL using `postgresql.enabled: true`

The MinIO (as the internal storage backend) and PostgreSQL (as the database backend) services are enabled by default to provide a fully working setup out of the box.

::alert{type="warning"}
All external services (Kafka, Elasticsearch, Zookeeper, MinIO, PostgreSQL) are deployed using unsecured configurations (no authentication, no TLS, etc.). When installing for a production environment, make sure to adjust their configurations to secure your deployment.
::

## Configuration

Here is how you can adjust the Kestra configuration:
- Using a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` via the `configuration` Helm value.
- Using a Kubernetes `Secret` via the `secrets` Helm value.

Both must be valid YAML that will be merged as the Kestra configuration file.

Here is an example showing how to enable Kafka as the queue implementation and configure its `bootstrap.servers` property using a secret:

```yaml
configuration:
  kestra:
    queue:
      type: kafka

secrets:
  kestra:
    kafka:
      client:
        properties:
          bootstrap.servers: "localhost:9092"
```

## Docker in Docker (DinD) Worker side car

By default, Docker in Docker (DinD) is installed on the worker in the `rootless` version.
This can be restricted on some environment due to security limitations.

Some solutions you may try:
- On Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), use a node pool based on `UBUNTU_CONTAINERD` that works well with Docker DinD, even rootless
- Some Kubernetes clusters support only a root version of DinD; to make your Kestra deployment work, [disable the rootless version](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L102-L106) using the following Helm chart values:

```yaml
dind:
  image:
    image: docker
    tag: dind
  args:
    - --log-level=fatal
```
