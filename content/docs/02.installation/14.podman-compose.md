Start Kestra with a PostgreSQL database backend using Podman Compose.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already installed:

- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Download the Docker Compose file
Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

Podman Compose will work using the provided Docker Compose file out of the box.

## Launch Kestra in Root Mode

Use the following command to create a Podman machine, start it up and launch Kestra on it:

```bash
podman machine init --cpus 2 --rootful -v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD
podman machine start
podman compose up -d
```

::alert{type="info"}
Podman executes containers through a VM on your local machine. In order to access local volumes from your container you need to ensure you mount these to the podman VM, hence the `-v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD` arguments.

Note: Check if you have an existing podman VM on your local machine by navigating to the 'Resources' tab in podman desktop or running the command `podman machine list` in your terminal. If you have an existing VM, ensure the required volumes are mounted as expected. If that does not work, you can [recreate the podman VM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69298356/how-to-mount-a-volume-from-a-local-machine-on-podman) with volumes mounted and then run Kestra.

Open the URL `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI.

### Adjusting the Configuration

The command above starts a *standalone* server (all architecture components in one JVM).

The [configuration](../10.references/index.md) will be done inside the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable of the Kestra container. You can update the environment variable inside the Docker compose file, or pass it via the Docker command line argument.

If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](../09.administrator-guide/16.troubleshooting.md).

### Use a configuration file

If you want to use a configuration file instead of the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable to configure Kestra you can update the default `docker-compose.yml`.

First, create a configuration file, for example named `application.yaml` and put inside the content of the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Then update `kestra` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file to mount this file into the container and make Kestra using it via the `--config` option:

```yaml
# [...]
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    pull_policy: always
    # Note that this is meant for development only. Refer to the documentation for production deployments of Kestra which runs without a root user.
    user: "root"
    command: server standalone --worker-thread=128 --config /etc/config/application.yaml
    volumes:
      - kestra-data:/app/storage
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /tmp/kestra-wd:/tmp/kestra-wd
      - $PWD/application.yaml:/etc/config/application.yaml
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_started
```

## Launch Kestra in Rootless Mode

Use the following command to create a Podman machine in rootless mode.

```bash
podman machine init --cpus 2
podman machine start
```

### Use a configuration file and start Kestra

Update `kestra` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file to remove the `user: "root"` configuration.

```yaml
# [...]
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    pull_policy: always
    # Note that this is meant for development only. Refer to the documentation for production deployments of Kestra which runs without a root user.
    #user: "root"  <--- ðŸ‘€ Comment this line
    command: server standalone --worker-thread=128 --config /etc/config/application.yaml
    volumes:
      - kestra-data:/app/storage
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /tmp/kestra-wd:/tmp/kestra-wd
      - $PWD/application.yaml:/etc/config/application.yaml
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_started
```

You can now run Kestra in rootless mode and use it for production purposes. From the same directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is present, run the following command to launch Kestra in rootless mode:

```bash
podman compose up -d
```
