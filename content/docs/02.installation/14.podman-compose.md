Start Kestra with a PostgreSQL database backend using Podman Compose.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already installed:

- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Download the Docker Compose file
Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

Podman Compose will work using the provided Docker Compose file out of the box.

## Launch Kestra in Root Mode

Use the following command to create a Podman machine, start it up and launch Kestra on it:

```bash
podman machine init --cpus 2 --rootful -v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD
podman machine start
podman compose up -d
```

::alert{type="info"}
Podman executes containers through a VM on your local machine. In order to access local volumes from your container you need to ensure you mount these to the podman VM, hence the `-v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD` arguments.

Note: Check if you have an existing podman VM on your local machine by navigating to the 'Resources' tab in podman desktop or running the command `podman machine list` in your terminal. If you have an existing VM, ensure the required volumes are mounted as expected. If that does not work, you can [recreate the podman VM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69298356/how-to-mount-a-volume-from-a-local-machine-on-podman) with volumes mounted and then run Kestra.

Open the URL `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI.

### Adjusting the Configuration

The command above starts a *standalone* server (all architecture components in one JVM).

The [configuration](../configuration/index.md) will be done inside the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable of the Kestra container. You can update the environment variable inside the Docker compose file, or pass it via the Docker command line argument.

::alert{type="info"}
If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](../09.administrator-guide/16.troubleshooting.md).

### Use a configuration file

If you want to use a configuration file instead of the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable to configure Kestra you can update the default `docker-compose.yml`.

First, create a configuration file, for example named `application.yaml` and put inside the content of the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Then update `kestra` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file to mount this file into the container and make Kestra using it via the `--config` option:

```yaml
# [...]
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    pull_policy: always
    # Note that this is meant for development only. Refer to the documentation for production deployments of Kestra which runs without a root user.
    user: "root"
    command: server standalone --worker-thread=128 --config /etc/config/application.yaml
    volumes:
      - kestra-data:/app/storage
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /tmp/kestra-wd:/tmp/kestra-wd
      - $PWD/application.yaml:/etc/config/application.yaml
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_started
```
