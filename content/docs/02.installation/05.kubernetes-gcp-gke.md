Deploy Kestra to GCP GKE with CloudSQL as a database backend and Google Cloud Storage as internal storage backend.

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying Kestra to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with CloudSQL as database backend, and Google Cloud Storage(GCS) for internal storage.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic command line interface skills.
- Familiarity with GCP GKE, PostgreSQL, GCS, and Kubernetes.

## Launch an GKE Cluster
First, login to GCP using `gcloud init`.

Run the following command to create an GKE cluster named `my-kestra-cluster`:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create my-kestra-cluster --region=europe-west3
```

Confirm using the GCP console that the cluster is up.

::alert{type="info"}
Before proceeding, check whether the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` plugin is already installed:

```shell
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin --version
```

If the output displays version information, skip this section.

You can install the authentication plugin using:
```shell
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```
::

Run the following command to have your kubecontext point to the newly created cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-kestra-cluster --region=europe-west3
```

You can now confirm that your kubecontext points to the GKE cluster using:

```shell
kubectl get svc
```

## Install Kestra on GCP GKE

Add the Kestra Helm chart repository and install Kestra:

```shell
helm repo add kestra https://helm.kestra.io/
helm install my-kestra kestra/kestra
```

## Workload Identity Setup

If you are using Google Cloud Workload Identity, you can annotate your Kubernetes service account in the Helm chart configuration. This will allow Kestra to automatically use the associated GCP service account for authentication.

To configure this, you can add the following to your "values.yaml" file:
```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: <your-service-account-name>
  annotations:
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: "<gcp-service-account>@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

```

Alternatively, you can apply the annotation directly when you install Kestra using Helm:

```shell
helm install my-kestra kestra/kestra \
  --set serviceAccount.annotations.iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=<gcp-service-account>@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This configuration links your Kubernetes service account to the GCP service account, enabling Workload Identity for secure access to Google Cloud resources.

## Launch CloudSQL

1. Go to the [Cloud SQL console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
2. Click on `Choose PostgreSQL` (Kestra also supports MySQL, but PostgreSQL is recommended).
3. Put an appropriate Instance ID and password for the admin user `postgres`.
4. Select the latest PostgreSQL version from the dropdown.
5. Choose `Enterprise Plus` or `Enterprise` edition based on your requirements.
6. Choose an appropriate preset among `Production`, `Development` or `Sandbox` as per your requirement.
7. Choose the appropriate region and zonal availability.
8. Hit create and wait for completion.

**Create database user**

1. Go to the database overview page and click on `Users` from the left-side navigation menu.
2. Click on `Add User Account`.
3. Put an appropriate username and password, and click on `Add`.

![db_users](/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/gcp-vm/db_users.png)

![db_user_creation](/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/gcp-vm/db_user_creation.png)

**Create Kestra database**

1. Go to the database overview page, and click on `Databases` from the left side navigation menu.
2. Click on `Create Database`.
3. Put an appropriate database name, and click on `Create`.

**Update Kestra configuration**

Here is how you can configure CloudSQL Database in the [Helm chart's values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L11):

```yaml
configuration:
  kestra:
    queue:
      type: postgres
    repository:
      type: postgres
  datasources:
    postgres:
      url: jdbc:postgresql://<your-db-external-endpoint>:5432/<db_name>
      driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
      username: <your-username>
      password: <your-password>
```

Also, disable the postgres pod by changing `enabled` value in the `postgresql` section from `true` to `false` in the same file.
```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: false
```

In order for the changes to take effect, run the `helm upgrade` command as:

```shell
helm upgrade my-kestra kestra/kestra -f values.yaml
```

## Prepare a GCS bucket

By default, minio pod is being used as storage backend. This section will guide you on how to change the storage backend to Google Cloud Storage.

By default, internal storage is implemented using the local file system. This section will guide you on how to change the storage backend to Cloud Storage to ensure more reliable, durable, and scalable storage.

1. Go to the Cloud Storage console and create a bucket.
2. Go to IAM and select `Service Accounts` from the left-side navigation menu.
3. On the Service Accounts page, click on `Create Service Account` at the top of the page.
4. Put the appropriate Service account name and Service account description, and grant the service account `Storage Admin` access. Click Done.
5. On the Service Accounts page, click on the newly created service account.
6. On the newly created service account page, go to the `Keys` tab at the top of the page and click on `Add Key.` From the dropdown, select `Create New Key`.
7. Select the Key type as `JSON` and click on `Create`. The JSON key file for the service account will get downloaded.
8. We will be using the stringified JSON for our configuration. You can use the bash command `% cat <path_to_json_file> | jq '@json'` to generate stringified JSON.
9. Edit Kestra storage configuration in the [Helm chart's values](https://github.com/kestra-io/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/kestra/values.yaml#L11).

*Note: If you want to use a Kubernetes service account configured as a workload identify, you don't need to provide anything for `serviceAccount` as it will be autodetected for the pod configuration if it's well configured.*

```yaml
configuration:
  kestra:
    storage:
      type: gcs
      gcs:
        bucket: "<your-cloud-storage-bucket-name>"
        projectId: "<your-gcp-project-name>"
        serviceAccount: |
          "<stringified-json-file-contents>"
```

Also, disable the minio pod by changing `enabled` value in the minio section from `true` to `false` in the same file.
```yaml
minio:
  enabled: false
```

In order for the changes to take effect, run the `helm upgrade` command as:

```shell
helm upgrade my-kestra kestra/kestra -f values.yaml
```

You can validate the storage change from minio to Google Cloud Storage by executing the flow example below with a file and then checking it is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.

```yaml
id: inputs
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: file
    type: FILE

tasks:
  - id: validator
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: User {{ inputs.file }}
```

## Commented-out Examples in values.yaml
To provide users with clear guidance on configuring the values.yaml file, we have included some commented-out examples in the configuration. These examples can be used to set up various aspects of Kestra, such as secrets, database configurations, and other key parameters. You can uncomment and modify them as needed.

Here’s an example of how you can define secrets and other configurations in the values.yaml file:

```yaml
# Example configuration for secrets:
configuration:
  kestra:
    # Configure this section to set secrets for your Kestra instance.
    # secret:
    #   - name: "MY_SECRET_KEY"
    #     value: "my-secret-value"
    #   - name: "ANOTHER_SECRET"
    #     valueFrom:
    #       secretKeyRef:
    #         name: "my-k8s-secret"
    #         key: "my-secret-key"

    # Configure this section to use PostgreSQL as the queue and repository backend.
    # queue:
    #   type: postgres
    # repository:
    #   type: postgres

    # Example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database:
    # datasources:
    #   postgres:
    #     url: jdbc:postgresql://<your-db-endpoint>:5432/<db-name>
    #     driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    #     username: <your-username>
    #     password: <your-password>

# Example to disable default services like MinIO and PostgreSQL if you're using external services:
minio:
  # enabled: false
postgresql:
  # enabled: false
```

In this example:

-**Secrets**: You can configure sensitive values as secrets, either hardcoding them or referencing existing Kubernetes secrets.  
-**Queue and Repository**: By default, these can use PostgreSQL or any other supported type. Uncomment the relevant lines to use them.  
-**PostgreSQL Configuration**: Set the datasources section to provide details for connecting to a PostgreSQL database.  
-**Disabling Services**: If you're using external services like CloudSQL or Google Cloud Storage, you can disable the built-in services (MinIO and PostgreSQL).  


Feel free to uncomment and modify these examples based on your setup needs. This provides flexibility while keeping your values.yaml well-structured.
