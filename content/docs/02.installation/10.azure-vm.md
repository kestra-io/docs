Install Kestra on Azure VM with Azure Database as a database backend and Blob Storage as internal storage backend.

This guide provides instructions for deploying Kestra on Azure VM with Azure Database as a database backend and Blob Storage as internal storage backend.

Prerequisites:
* basic knowledge about using a command line interface
* basic knowledge about Azure and PostgreSQL.

## Create an Azure VM

First, create a virtual machine using Azure Virtual Machines. To do so, go to the Azure portal and choose [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines).
1. Click on `Create` and select `Azure Virtual Machine`.
2. Choose an appropriate `Subscription` and `Resource Group`.
3. Give a name for your VM, and choose a `Region` where it should be launched.
4. For `Availability options`, choose `Availabilty zone`, and keep the default availability zone.
5. For `Image`, choose `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS - x64 Gen2`, and `x64` as the VM architecture.
6. Kestra needs at least 4GiB Memory and 2vCPU to run correctly. Choosing the `Size` as `Standard_D2s_v3` is a good starting point.
7. Select `SSH public key` as the `Authentication type`.
8. You can keep the default `azureuser` as the `Username`.
9. For `SSH public key source`, you can select `Generate new key pair`, and provide an appropriate name for the key pair.
10. For `Public inbound ports`, choose `Allow selected ports`, and from the `Select inbound ports` dropdown, select `HTTPS` and `SSH`.
11. Click on `Review + Create`.
12. You can now review the configurations and click on "Create". On the `Generate new key pair` popup, click on `Download private key and create` resource.

## Install Docker
In your terminal, run the following commands to SSH into the virtual machine:

```shell
chmod 400 <your-key-pair.pem>
ssh -i <your-key-pair.pem> azureuser@<your-VM-public-IP>
```

Kestra can be started directly from a `.jar` binary or using Docker. We’ll use Docker here for a quick setup:
1. Install Docker on the Azure VM instance. [You can find the last updated instruction on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
2. [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


To check your installation, run `sudo docker version` and `sudo docker compose version`. You're now ready to download and launch the Kestra server.


## Install Kestra

Download the official Docker-Compose file:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

Use an editor such as Vim to modify the `docker-compose.yml`, set basic authentication to `true`, and configure your basic authentication credentials to secure your Kestra instance.

```yaml
kestra:
  server:
    basicAuth:
      enabled: true
      username: admin@kestra.io # it must be a valid email address
      password: kestra
```

Then, use the following command to start the Kestra server:
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Allow external traffic

Kestra is now running and the Kestra server exposes traffic on the `8080` port. To connect through your web browser, update the inbound traffic rules in the Azure security group.

1. Go to the Virtual Machines console, and select the recently created virtual machine.
2. On the left navigation menu, click on `Networking`.
3. Under `Inbound port rules` tab, click on the `Add inbound port rule` button.
4. In the `Add inbound security rule` page, put `Destination port ranges` as `8080`. You can keep the default values for the remaining properties. Finally, click on `Add` at the bottom of the page.

If you want to only allow traffic coming from your local machine, set the `Source` to your own IP address. To open the instance to the entire Internet, leave it at `Any`.

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that if you haven't set up basic authentication in the previous step, your Kestra instance will be publicly available to anyone without any access restriction.
::

You can now access your Kestra instance and start developing flows.


## Launch Azure Database

This first installation relies on a PostgreSQL database running alongside the Kestra server - on the VM instance (see the PostgreSQL service running thanks to the docker-compose).

For a simple proof of concept (PoC), you can keep the PostgreSQL database running in Docker.

However, for a production-grade installation, we recommend a managed database service such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers.

**Launch a database using Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers**

1. Go to the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL%2Fservers).
2. Click on `Create Azure Database for PostgreSQL server` (Kestra also supports MySQL, but PostgreSQL is recommended).
3. Choose an appropriate `Subscription` and `Resource Group`.
4. Put an appropriate `Server name`, and select the preferred `Region`.
5. Choose the latest `PostgreSQL version`. We recommend version 15.
6. Select the `Workload type` as per your requirement.
7. Choose `Authentication method` as `PostgreSQL authentication only`.
8. Provide an appropriate `Admin username` and `Password`, and re-write the password in `Confirm password`.
9. Click on `Next: Networking`.
10. Click on the select box for `Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server`.
11. Click on `Review + Create`. Review the configurations and click on `Create`.
12. Wait for the database to be provisioned.

![db_setup2](/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/azure-vm/db_setup2.png)

![db_setup3](/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/azure-vm/db_setup3.png)

**Create a Kestra database**

1. Go to the database overview page, and click on `Databases` from the left side navigation menu.
2. Click on `Add`.
3. Put an appropriate database name, and click on `Save` at the top.

**Update Kestra configuration**

In the docker-compose configuration, edit the `datasources` property of the Kestra service to point Kestra to your Azure database:

```yaml
datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<your-db-external-endpoint>:5432/<db_name>
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: <your-username>
    password: <your-password>
```

Because you now use the "Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers" service, you don't need the PostgreSQL Docker service anymore. Remove it from the `docker-compose.yml` file.

In order for the changes to take effect, restart the docker services with `sudo docker compose restart` or `sudo docker compose up -d`.

## Configure Azure Blob Storage

By default, internal storage is implemented using the local file system. This section will guide you on how to change the storage backend to Blob Storage to ensure more reliable, durable, and scalable storage.

1. Go to the [Storage Accounts](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts).
2. Click on `Create`.
3. Choose an appropriate `Subscription` and `Resource Group`.
4. Put an appropriate `Storage account name`, and select the preferred `Region`.
5. Select `Performance` and `Redundancy` as per your requirement.
6. Click on `Review`, and post reviewing the configurations, click on `Create`.
7. Click on the newly created storage account.
8. On the storage account overview page, click on the `Containers` from the left side navigation menu.
9. Click on `Create` button at the top to create a new container.
10. Put an appropriate name for the container, and click on `Create`. A new container will be created.
11. Now, click on `Access keys` from the left side navigation menu.
12. For one of the keys, either key1 or key2, click on `Show` for the `Connection string`, and click on `Copy to clipboard` button.
13. Note down the connection string with you. We will require this for configuring the storage backend.
14. Edit the Kestra storage configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
kestra:
  storage:
    type: azure
    azure:
      container: "<your-container>"
      endpoint: "https://<your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/"
      connectionString: "<your-connection-string>"
```

In order for the changes to take effect, restart the docker services with `sudo docker compose restart` or `sudo docker compose up -d`.
