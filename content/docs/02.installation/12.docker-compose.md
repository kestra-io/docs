Start Kestra with a Postgres database backend using a Docker Compose file.

Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.


Then, use the following command to start Kestra server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to launch the UI.
