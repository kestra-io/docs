Start Kestra with a Postgres database backend using a Docker Compose file.

The quickest way to a production-ready lightweight Kestra installation is to leverage Docker and Docker Compose. This guide will help you get started with Kestra using Docker.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Launch Kestra

### Download the Docker Compose file
Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

### Launch Kestra

Use the following command to start the Kestra server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Open the URL `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI.

### Adjusting the configuration

The command above starts a *standalone* server (all architecture components in one JVM).


The [configuration](../10.configuration-guide/index.md) will be done inside the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable of the Kestra container. You can update the environment variable inside the Docker compose file, or pass it via the Docker command line argument.
