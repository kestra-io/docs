Start Kestra with a Postgres database backend using Podman Compose.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already installed:

- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Download the Docker Compose file
Download the Docker Compose file using the following command:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml
```

If you don't have `curl` installed, you can download the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) manually and save it as `docker-compose.yml`.

Podman Compose will work using the provided Docker Compose file out of the box.

## Launch Kestra

Use the following command to create a Podman machine, start it up and launch Kestra on it:

```bash
podman machine init --cpus 2 --rootful -v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD
podman machine start
podman compose up -d
```

::alert{type="info"}
Podman executes containers through a VM on your local machine. In order to access local volumes from your container you need to ensure you mount these to the podman VM, hence the `-v /tmp:/tmp -v $PWD:$PWD` arguments.  
::

Open the URL `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to launch the UI.

### Adjusting the Configuration

The command above starts a *standalone* server (all architecture components in one JVM).

The [configuration](/docs/configuration-guide) will be done inside the `KESTRA_CONFIGURATION` environment variable of the Kestra container. You can update the environment variable inside the Docker compose file, or pass it via the Docker command line argument.

If you want to extend your Docker Compose file, modify container networking, or if you have any other issues using this Docker Compose file, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/faq/troubleshooting).
