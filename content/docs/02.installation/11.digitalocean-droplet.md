Install Kestra on DigitalOcean Droplet with DigitalOcean Database as a database backend.

This guide provides instructions for deploying Kestra on DigitalOcean Droplet with Managed Database from DigitalOcean as a database backend.

Prerequisites:

* basic knowledge about using a command line interface
* basic knowledge about DigitalOcean and PostgreSQL

## Create a DigitalOcean Droplet

First, we will create a virtual machine known as a Droplet in DigitalOcean. To do so, go to the DigitalOcean portal and choose [Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) from the left navigation bar.

1. On the Droplets page, click on `Create Droplet` button. This will navigate you to the "Create Droplets" page.
2. Choose an appropriate region.
3. Choose `Ubuntu` as the OS image with the latest version.
4. Kestra needs at least 4GiB Memory and 2vCPU to run correctly. You can go with Shared or Dedicated CPU configuraton options as per your requirement. Here, we are choosing `Basic` plan with `Regular` CPU option, and a plan that provides us with 4GiB Memory and 2vCPU.
5. You can choose an appropriate authentication method: SSH Key or Password based.
6. Provide an appropriate hostname, and click on the `Create Droplet` button at the bottom.

Wait until the virtual machine is up and running. From the Droplets page, you can navigate to the recently created Droplet. From here, you can open the machine's console by clicking on the `Console` button at the top.

## Install Docker

Once in the console terminal, you can run the commands to install Kestra.

Kestra can be started directly from a `.jar` binary or using Docker. Weâ€™ll use Docker here for a quick setup:
1. Install Docker on the Droplet. [You can find the last updated instruction on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
2. [Install docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To check your installation, run `sudo docker version` and `sudo docker compose version`. You're now ready to download and launch the Kestra server.

## Install Kestra

Download the official Docker-Compose file: `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/kestra/develop/docker-compose.yml`

Use an editor such as Vim to modify the `docker-compose.yml`, set basic authentication to `true`, and configure your basic authentication credentials to secure your Kestra instance.

```yaml
kestra:
  server:
    basic-auth:
      enabled: true
      username: admin@kestra.io # it must be a valid email address
      password: kestra
```

Then, use the following command to start the Kestra server:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

You can now access the Kestra UI at `http://<public_droplet_ip>:8080` and start developing flows.

## Launch DigitalOcean Database

This first installation relies on a PostgreSQL database running alongside the Kestra server - on the VM instance (see the PostgreSQL service running thanks to the docker-compose).

For a simple proof of concept (PoC), you can keep the PostgreSQL database running in Docker.

However, for a production-grade installation, we recommend a managed database service such as DigitalOcean Database.

**Launch a PostgreSQL database using [DigitalOcean Database](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql)**

1. Go to the [DigitalOcean Databases](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases).
2. Click on `Create Database` button on the top.
3. Choose an appropriate region and select `PostgreSQL` as the database engine (Kestra also supports MySQL, but PostgreSQL is recommended).
4. Choose the database configuration as per your requirement.
5. Provide an appropriate database cluster name.
6. Click on the `Create Database Cluster` button at the bottom of the page.
7. Wait for the database to be provisioned. Generally, this takes around 5 minutes.

![db_setup3](/docs/administrator-guide/deployment/digitalocean-droplet/db_setup3.png)

8. Once the database is ready, you can click on the `Get Started` button.
9. In the `Add trusted sources` dropbox, you can select your computer (in case you want to connect to this database from the PostgreSQL client running on your computer), and the `kestra-host` droplet created in the earlier section.
10. Click on `Allow these inbound sources only`.
11. On this page, ensure `Public network` is selected on the top. Take a note of the Connection Details that appear, and click on `Continue`.
12. On the next page, click on `Great, I'm done` button.

**Create a Kestra database**

1. Go to the database overview page, navigate to `Users & Databases` tab.
2. Under `Databases`, type an appropriate database name, and click on `Save`.

**Update Kestra configuration**

In the docker-compose configuration, edit the `datasources` property of the Kestra service to point Kestra to your Azure database:

```yaml
datasources:
  postgres:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<your-db-host>:25060/<db_name>
    driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
    username: doadmin
    password: <your-password>
```

Because you now use the database powered by "DigitalOcean Database", you don't need the Postgres Docker service anymore. Remove it from the `docker-compose.yml` file.
You'll also need to delete the `depends_on` section at the end of the YAML file:

```yaml
depends_on:
  postgres:
    condition: service_started
In order for the changes to take effect, restart the docker services with `sudo docker compose restart` or `sudo docker compose up -d`.

## Configure Spaces Object Storage

We do not have support for Spaces Object Storage yet. For now, you'll need to use a different service such as S3, GCS or Azure Blob Storage.

## Next steps

This guide walked you through installing Kestra on a DigitalOcean Droplet with DigitalOcean Database.

This setup provides a simple starting point for running Kestra in production on a single machine.

Reach out via [Slack](https://kestra.io/slack) if you encounter any issues or if you have any questions regarding deploying Kestra to production.

Make sure to also check the [CI/CD guide](/docs/developer-guide/cicd) to automate your workflow deployments based on changes in Git.
