Run tasks after a flow execution completes.

`afterExecution` tasks run once a flow has finished, allowing you to act on the final execution status.

## `afterExecution` property

`afterExecution` is a block of tasks that run after the flow ends. You can use it to run conditional tasks based on the final state, such as **SUCCESS** or **FAILED**. This is especially useful for custom notifications and alerts. For example, you can combine `afterExecution` with the `runIf` property to send different Slack messages depending on the execution state.

```yaml
id: alerts_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

afterExecution:
  - id: onSuccess
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'SUCCESS'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    messageText: "{{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} finished successfully!"

  - id: onFailure
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'FAILED'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    messageText: "Oh no, {{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} failed!!!"
```

Any errors in the `afterExecution` block will not change the state of the flow from Success to Failed, and will not trigger a flow that relies on ExecutionStatus = Failed. You can create a state change by using a [Sequential flowable task](./01.tasks/00.flowable-tasks.md#sequential) with an `errors` block like in the example below:
```
afterExecution:
  - id: t2
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Sequential
    tasks:
      - id: t2-t1
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Sleep
        duration: "PT5S"
      - id: t2-t2
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    errors:
      - id: sendAlert
        type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
        url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
        messageText: "Flow {{ flow.namespace }}.{{ flow.id }} with execution ID {{ execution.id }} failed."
```

## `afterExecution` vs `finally`

`afterExecution` and `finally` are both end-of-flow constructs, but they serve different purposes.

The `afterExecution` property differs from the `finally` property because:
1. `finally` runs tasks at the end of the flow while the execution is still in a `RUNNING` state.
2. `afterExecution` runs tasks after the execution finishes in a terminal state like **SUCCESS** or **FAILED**.

Use `finally` for cleanup operations that should always run, regardless of the outcome. See the [`finally` documentation](./19.finally.md) for examples. When follow-up actions depend on the final state, use `afterExecution` to capture the result.

To demonstrate, take the following flow that uses both `finally` and `afterExecution`:

```yaml
id: state_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: run
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Will show RUNNING

  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

finally:
  - id: finally
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Will show RUNNING

afterExecution:
  - id: afterExecution
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Execution {{ execution.state }} # Will show FAILED
```

After executing the above, you can see that the `finally` task has a status of RUNNING while the `afterExecution` task says FAILED.

Best practice: Use `afterExecution` when you need to act on the final state of an execution. Use `finally` when you need to ensure cleanup happens regardless of state.
