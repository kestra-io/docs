title: Task Runs

A task run is a single execution of an individual task within an [Execution](../03.execution.md), where an execution represents a run of the entire flow. One execution can therefore contain multiple task runs.

Each task run includes associated data such as:

- Execution ID
- State
- Start Date
- End Date

## Attempts

A task run can include one or more attempts. Most have only a single attempt, but you can configure [retries](../12.retries.md) if needed.
When retries are enabled, a task failure triggers new attempts until the `maxAttempts` or `maxDuration` threshold is reached.

## States

Similar to executions, task runs can exist in different states.

| State | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| - |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CREATED` | The task run is waiting to be processed, usually queued and not yet started.                                                                                                 |
| `RUNNING` | The execution or task run is currently being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SUCCESS` | The execution or task run has been completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `WARNING` | The task run had issues but continued, flagged with a warning.                                                                                                                      |
| `FAILED` | The task run encountered errors that caused the execution to fail.                                                                                                                                    |
| `RETRYING` | The execution or task run is currently being [retried](../12.retries.md).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `RETRIED` | An execution or task run exhibited unintended behavior, stopped, and created a new execution as defined by its [flow-level retry policy](../12.retries.md#flow-level-retries). The policy was set to the `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` behavior. |
| `KILLING` | A kill command was issued and the system is terminating the task run.                                                                                        |
| `KILLED` | An execution or task run was killed (upon request), and no more tasks will run.                                                                                                                                                           |

## Expression

You can access information about the current task run using the `{{ taskrun }}` expression.

The following example outputs task run details using `{{ taskrun }}`:

```yaml
id: taskrun
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: return
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ taskrun }}"
```

The logs show the following:

```json
{
    "id": "61TxwXQjkXfwTd4ANK6fhv",
    "startDate": "2024-11-13T14:38:38.355668Z",
    "attemptsCount": 0
}
```

## Task run values

Some [Flowable tasks](./00.flowable-tasks.md), such as [ForEach](./00.flowable-tasks.md) and [ForEachItem](./00.flowable-tasks.md#foreachitem), group tasks together. You can use `{{ taskrun.value }}` to access the value of a specific task run.

In the example below, `foreach` iterates twice over the values `[1, 2]`:

```yaml
id: loop
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: foreach
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: [1, 2]
    tasks:
      - id: log
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
        message:
        - "{{ taskrun }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.value }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.id }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.startDate }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.attemptsCount }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.parentId }}"
        - "{{ taskrun.iteration }}"
```
This produces two separate log entries, one with `1` and the other with `2`.

### Parent task run values

You can also use the `{{ parent.taskrun.value }}` expression to access a task run value from a parent task within nested flowable child tasks:

```yaml
id: loop
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: foreach
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: [1, 2]
    tasks:
      - id: log
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
        message: "{{ taskrun.value }}"
      - id: if
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
        condition: "{{ true }}"
        then:
          - id: log_parent
            type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
            message: "{{ parent.taskrun.value }}"
```

This iterates through the `log` and `if` tasks twice as there are two items in `values` property. The `log_parent` task logs the parent task run value as `1` and then `2`.

### Parent vs. parents in nested Flowable tasks

With nested [Flowable tasks](./00.flowable-tasks.md), only the immediate parent is available through `taskrun.value`. To access a parent task higher up the tree, you can use the `parent` and the `parents` expressions.

The following flow shows a more complex example with nested flowable parent tasks:

```yaml
id: each_switch
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: simple
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message:
      - "{{ task.id }}"
      - "{{ taskrun.startDate }}"

  - id: hierarchy_1
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: ["caseA", "caseB"]
    tasks:
      - id: hierarchy_2
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch
        value: "{{ taskrun.value }}"
        cases:
          caseA:
            - id: hierarchy_2_a
              type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
              format: "{{ task.id }}"
          caseB:
            - id: hierarchy_2_b_first
              type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
              format: "{{ task.id }}"

            - id: hierarchy_2_b_second
              type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
              values: ["case1", "case2"]
              tasks:
                - id: switch
                  type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch
                  value: "{{ taskrun.value }}"
                  cases:
                    case1:
                      - id: switch_1
                        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
                        message:
                          - "{{ parents[0].taskrun.value }}"
                          - "{{ parents[1].taskrun.value }}"
                    case2:
                      - id: switch_2
                        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
                        message:
                          - "{{ parents[0].taskrun.value }}"
                          - "{{ parents[1].taskrun.value }}"
  - id: simple_again
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message:
      - "{{ task.id }}"
      - "{{ taskrun.startDate }}"
```

The `parent` variable gives direct access to the first parent, while the `parents[INDEX]` gives you access to the parent higher up the tree.
