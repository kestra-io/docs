Control your orchestration logic.

Flowable tasks control orchestration logic — running tasks or subflows in parallel, creating loops, and handling conditional branching. They do not run heavy operations; those are handled by workers.

Flowable tasks use [expressions](../../expressions/index.md) from the execution context to determine which tasks run next. For example, you can use the outputs of a previous task in a `Switch` task to decide which task to run next.

### Sequential

This task runs tasks sequentially and is typically used to group them.

```yaml
id: sequential
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: sequential
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Sequential
    tasks:
      - id: 1st
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"

      - id: 2nd
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.id }}"

  - id: last
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"
```

:::alert{type="info"}
You can access the output of a sibling task using the syntax `{{ outputs.sibling.value }}`.
:::

For more details on capabilities, check out the [Sequential Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Sequential).

### Parallel

This task runs tasks in parallel, making it convenient to process many tasks simultaneously.

```yaml
id: parallel
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: parallel
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel
    tasks:
      - id: 1st
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"

      - id: 2nd
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.id }}"

  - id: last
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"
```

:::alert{type="warning"}
You cannot access the output of a sibling task as tasks will be run in parallel.
:::

For more task details, refer to the [Parallel Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel).

### Switch

This task conditionally runs tasks based on the value of a contextual variable.

In the following example, an input is used to decide which task to run next.

```yaml
id: switch
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: param
    type: BOOLEAN

tasks:
  - id: decision
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch
    value: "{{ inputs.param }}"
    cases:
      true:
        - id: is_true
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: "This is true"
      false:
        - id: is_false
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: "This is false"
```

For more plugin details, refer to the [Switch Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch).

### If

This task processes a set of tasks conditionally depending on a condition.

The condition must evaluate to a boolean. Values such as `0`, `-0`, `null`, and `''` evaluate to `false`; all other values evaluate to `true`.
The `else` branch is optional.

In the following example, an input is used to decide which task to run next.

```yaml
id: if_condition
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: param
    type: BOOLEAN

tasks:
  - id: if
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
    condition: "{{ inputs.param }}"
    then:
      - id: when_true
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
        message: "This is true"
    else:
      - id: when_false
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
        message: "This is false"
```

For more details, check out the [If Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If).

### ForEach

This task executes a group of tasks for each value in the list.

In the following example, the variable is static, but it could also be generated from a previous task output, starting any number of subtasks.

```yaml
id: foreach_example
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: for_each
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: ["value 1", "value 2", "value 3"]
    tasks:
      - id: before_if
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "Before if {{ taskrun.value }}"
      - id: if
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
        condition: '{{ taskrun.value == "value 2" }}'
        then:
          - id: after_if
            type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
            format: "After if {{ parent.taskrun.value }}"
```

In this execution, you can access:

- The iteration value i.e., the index of a loop (the loop index starts at 0) using the syntax `{{ taskrun.iteration }}`
- The output of a sibling task using the syntax `{{ outputs.sibling[taskrun.value].value }}`

---

This example shows how to run tasks in parallel for each value in the list. All child tasks of the parallel task run in parallel. However, due to the `concurrencyLimit` property set to 2, only two parallel task groups run at any given time.

```yaml
id: parallel_tasks_example
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: for_each
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    concurrencyLimit: 2
    tasks:
      - id: parallel
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel
        tasks:
        - id: log
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: Processing {{ parent.taskrun.value }}
        - id: shell
          type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
          commands:
            - sleep {{ parent.taskrun.value }}
```

For more information on handling outputs generated from `ForEach`, check out this [dedicated loop how-to guide](../../15.how-to-guides/loop.md).

For processing items, or forwarding processing to a subflow, [ForEachItem](#foreachitem) is better suited.

:::alert{type="info"}
For more details, refer to the [ForEach Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flow/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.foreach).
:::

### ForEachItem

This task iterates over a list of items and runs a subflow for each item, or for each batch of items.

```yaml
  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ inputs.file }}" # could be also an output variable {{ outputs.extract.uri }}
    inputs:
      file: "{{ taskrun.items }}" # items of the batch
    batch:
      rows: 4
    namespace: company.team
    flowId: subflow
    revision: 1 # optional (default: latest)
    wait: true # wait for the subflow execution
    transmitFailed: true # fail the task run if the subflow execution fails
    labels: # optional labels to pass to the subflow to be executed
      key: value
```

This executes the subflow `company.team.subflow` for each batch of items.
To pass the batch of items to a subflow, you can use inputs. The example above uses an input of `FILE` type called `file` that takes the URI of an internal storage file containing the batch of items.

The next example shows you how to access the outputs from each subflow executed. The ForEachItem automatically merges the URIs of the outputs from each subflow into a single file. The URI of this file is available through the `subflowOutputs` output.

```yaml
id: for_each_item
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: generate
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Script
    script: |
      for i in $(seq 1 10); do echo "$i" >> data; done
    outputFiles:
      - data

  - id: for_each_item
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ outputs.generate.outputFiles.data }}"
    batch:
      rows: 4
    wait: true
    flowId: my_subflow
    namespace: company.team
    inputs:
       value: "{{ taskrun.items }}"

  - id: for_each_outputs
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ outputs.forEachItem_merge.subflowOutputs }}" # Log the URI of the file containing the URIs of the outputs from each subflow
```

:::alert{type="info"}
For more details, refer to the [ForEachItem Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEachItem).
:::

#### `ForEach` vs `ForEachItem`

Both `ForEach` and `ForEachItem` are similar, but there are specific use cases that suit one over the other:
- `ForEach` generates a lot of [Task Runs](./02.taskruns.md) which can impact performance.
- `ForEachItem` generates separate executions using [Subflows](../10.subflows.md) for the group of tasks. This scales better for larger datasets.

Read more about performance optimization in our [best practices guides](../../14.best-practices/0.flows.md#task-in-the-same-execution).

### LoopUntil

`LoopUntil` runs a group of tasks repeatedly until a boolean condition evaluates to `true`. After each iteration, the task evaluates the `condition` expression; if it evaluates to `false`, the block is executed again after the configured interval.

Typical use cases include polling an external API, waiting for a long-running job to transition to a terminal state, or checking for the presence of downstream resources.

Key properties:

- `condition` — expression evaluated after each iteration; has access to the child task outputs from the most recent run (e.g. `{{ outputs.checkStatus.code }}`).
- `tasks` — the list of child tasks to run before re-evaluating the condition.
- `checkFrequency` — optional guardrails that define `interval`, `maxIterations`, and/or `maxDuration` between repeats. (See the [LoopUntil migration note](../../11.migration-guide/0.23.0/loop-until-defaults.md) for default values.)

Example: poll an API until it returns HTTP 200, checking every 30 seconds and stopping after 50 attempts if it never succeeds.

```yaml
id: loop_until
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: loop
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.LoopUntil
    condition: "{{ outputs.ping.code == 200 }}"
    checkFrequency:
      interval: PT30S
      maxIterations: 50
    tasks:
      - id: ping
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
        method: GET
        uri: https://kestra.io/api/mock
```

For more details, refer to the [LoopUntil Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.LoopUntil).

### AllowFailure

This task allows child tasks to fail.

If any child task fails:
- The `AllowFailure` task is marked with status `WARNING`.
- All child tasks inside `AllowFailure` stop immediately.
- The execution continues for all other tasks.
- At the end, the execution as a whole is marked as status `WARNING`.

In the following example:
- `allow_failure` will be labelled as `WARNING`.
- `ko` will be labelled as `FAILED`.
- `next` will not be run.
- `end` will be run and labelled `SUCCESS`.

```yaml
id: each
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: allow_failure
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.AllowFailure
    tasks:
      - id: ko
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
      - id: next
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"

  - id: end
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"
```

:::alert{type="info"}
For more details, refer to the [AllowFailure Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.AllowFailure).
:::

### Fail

This task fails the flow; it can be used with or without conditions.

Without conditions, it can be used, for example, to fail on some switch value.

```yaml
id: fail_on_switch
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: param
    type: STRING
    required: true

tasks:
  - id: switch
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch
    value: "{{ inputs.param }}"
    cases:
      case1:
        - id: case1
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: Case 1
      case2:
        - id: case2
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: Case 2
      notexist:
        - id: fail
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
      default:
        - id: default
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: default
```

With conditions, it can be used, for example, to validate inputs.

```yaml
id: fail_on_condition
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: param
    type: STRING
    required: true

tasks:
  - id: before
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "I'm before the fail on condition"
  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    condition: "{{ inputs.param == 'fail' }}"
  - id: after
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "I'm after the fail on condition"
```

For more information, refer to the [Fail Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/executions/io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail).

### Subflow

This task triggers another flow. This enables you to decouple the first flow from the second and monitor each flow individually.

You can pass flow outputs as inputs to the triggered subflow (those must be declared in the subflow).

```yaml
id: subflow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: "subflow"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow
    namespace: company.team
    flowId: my-subflow
    inputs:
      file: "{{ inputs.myFile }}"
      store: 12
```

For more details, refer to the [Subflow Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow).

### WorkingDirectory

By default, Kestra launches each task in a new working directory, possibly on different workers if multiple ones exist.

The example below runs all tasks nested under the `WorkingDirectory` task sequentially in the same directory, allowing downstream tasks to reuse output files from previous ones. In order to share a working directory, all tasks nested under the `WorkingDirectory` task are launched on the same worker.

This task can be particularly useful for compute-intensive file system operations.

```yaml
id: working_dir_flow
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: working_dir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: first
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        taskRunner:
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
        commands:
          - 'echo "{{ taskrun.id }}" > {{ workingDir }}/stay.txt'

      - id: second
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        taskRunner:
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
        commands:
          - |
            echo '::{"outputs": {"stay":"'$(cat {{ workingDir }}/stay.txt)'"}}::'
```

This task can also cache files inside the working directory, for example, to cache script dependencies like the `node_modules` of a node `Script` task.

```yaml
id: node_with_cache
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: working_dir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    cache:
      patterns:
        - node_modules/**
      ttl: PT1H
    tasks:
      - id: script
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.node.Script
        beforeCommands:
          - npm install colors
        script: |
          const colors = require("colors");
          console.log(colors.red("Hello"));
```

This task can also fetch files from [namespace files](../../06.concepts/02.namespace-files.md) and make them available to all child tasks.

```yaml
id: node_with_cache
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: working_dir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
      include:
        - dir1/*.*
      exclude:
        - dir2/*.*
    tasks:
      - id: shell
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        commands:
          - cat dir1/file1.txt
```

:::alert{type="info"}
[WorkingDirectory Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory)
:::

### Pause

Kestra flows run until all tasks complete, but sometimes you need to:
- Add a manual validation before continuing the execution
- Wait for some duration before continuing the execution

For this, you can use the Pause task.

In the following example, the `validation` task pauses until it is manually resumed, while the `wait` task pauses for 5 minutes.

```yaml
id: pause
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: validation
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    tasks:
      - id: ok
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        taskRunner:
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
        commands:
          - 'echo "started after manual validation"'

  - id: wait
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    delay: PT5M
    tasks:
      - id: waited
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        taskRunner:
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
        commands:
          - 'echo "start after 5 minutes"'
```

:::alert{type="info"}
A Pause task without delay waits indefinitely until the task state is changed to **Running**.
For this: go to the **Gantt** tab of the **Execution** page, click on the task, select **Change status** on the contextual menu, and select **Mark as RUNNING** on the form. This makes the task run until its end. For more details, refer to the [Pause Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause).
:::

### DAG

This task allows defining dependencies between tasks by creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Instead of an explicit DAG structure, this task defines dependencies for each task using the `dependsOn` property. This way, you can set dependencies more implicitly for each task, and Kestra figures out the overall flow structure.

```yaml
id: dag
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: dag
    description: "my task"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Dag
    tasks:
      - task:
          id: task1
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: I'm the task 1
      - task:
          id: task2
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: I'm the task 2
        dependsOn:
          - task1
      - task:
          id: task3
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: I'm the task 3
        dependsOn:
          - task1
      - task:
          id: task4
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: I'm the task 4
        dependsOn:
          - task2
      - task:
          id: task5
          type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
          message: I'm the task 5
        dependsOn:
          - task4
          - task3
```

For more details, refer to the [Dag Task documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Dag).

### Template (deprecated)

Templates are lists of tasks that can be shared between flows. You can define a template and call it from other flows, allowing them to share a list of tasks and keep these tasks updated without changing your flow.

The following example uses the Template task to use a template.

```yaml
id: template
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: template
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Template
    namespace: company.team
    templateId: template
```
