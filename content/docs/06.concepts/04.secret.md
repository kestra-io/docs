Store sensitive information securely.

Secret is a mechanism that allows you to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, and retrieve them in your flows.

To retrieve secrets in a flow, use the `secret()` function, e.g., `"{{ secret('API_TOKEN'') }}"`. You can leverage your existing secrets manager as a secrets backend.

Your flows often need to interact with external systems. To do that, they need to programmatically authenticate using passwords or API keys. Secrets help you securely store such variables and avoid hard-coding sensitive information within your workflow code.

You can leverage the `secret()` function to retrieve sensitive variables within your flow code.

## Secrets in the Enterprise Edition

From the **Secrets** tab, you can edit, delete, and copy your secret to your clipboard as a Pebble expression for use in a flow, such as `"{{ secret('API_TOKEN'') }}"`.

### Adding a new Secret from the UI

If you are using a managed Kestra version, you can add **new Secrets** directly from the UI. In the left navigation menu, go to **Namespaces** and select the namespace to which you want to add a new secret. Next, add a new secret within the Secrets tab.

![Secrets EE](/docs/developer-guide/secrets/secrets-ee-1.png)

Here, we add a new secret with a key `MY_SECRET`. You can also include a short description and tags.

### Using secrets in your flows
For a concrete example of using secrets in flows, check out our dedicated [How-To Guide on Secrets](../15.how-to-guides/secrets.md).

### Secret management backends

Kestra [Enterprise Edition](../07.enterprise/index.md) provides additional secret management backends and integrations with secrets managers. See the [Secrets Manager](../07.enterprise/02.governance/secrets-manager.md) page for more details.

## Secrets in the Open-Source version

When using the open-source version, sensitive variables can be managed using base64-encoded environment variables. The section below demonstrates several ways to encode those values and use them in your Kestra instance.

### Manual encoding using a CLI command

Imagine that so far, you were setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export MYPASSWORD=myPrivateCode
```

Below is how you can encode the sensitive value of that environment variable:

```bash
echo -n "myPrivateCode" | base64
```

This outputs the value: `bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==`

To use that value as a Secret in your Kestra instance, you would need to add a prefix `SECRET_` to the variable key (here: `SECRET_MYPASSWORD`) and set that key to the encoded value:

```bash
export SECRET_MYPASSWORD=bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==
```

If you want to add the environment variable to the `kestra` container section in a [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml#L22), it would look as follows:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    environment:
      SECRET_MYPASSWORD: bXlQcml2YXRlQ29kZQ==
```

This secret can be used in a flow using the `{{ secret('MYPASSWORD') }}` syntax, and it will be base64-decoded during flow execution. Make sure to not include the prefix `SECRET_` when calling the `secret('MYPASSWORD')` function, as this prefix is only there in the environment variable definition to prevent Kestra from treating other system variables as secrets (for better performance and increased security).

Lastly, if you want to reference any non_encoded environment variables in your flows definition, you can always use the syntax `{{envs.lowercase_environment_variable_key}}`.

:::alert{type="warning"}
Note that Kestra has built-in protection to prevent its logs from revealing any encoded secret you have defined.

### Convert all variables in an `.env` file

The previous section showed the process for one Secret, but if you have tens or hundreds of them, then the `.env` is better suited.

Let's assume that you have an `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
MYPASSWORD=password
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=mypat
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myawsaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=myawssecretaccesskey

```

Make sure to keep the last line empty, otherwise the bash script below won't encode the last secret `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` correctly.

Using the bash script shown below, you can:
1. Encode all values using base64-encoding
2. Add a `SECRET_` prefix to all environment variable names
3. Store the result as `.env_encoded`

```bash
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
    echo "SECRET_$key=$(echo -n "$value" | base64)";
done < .env > .env_encoded
```

The `.env_encoded` file should look as follows:

```bash
SECRET_MYPASSWORD=cGFzc3dvcmQ=
SECRET_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=bXlwYXQ=
SECRET_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=bXlhd3NhY2Nlc3NrZXk=
SECRET_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bXlhd3NzZWNyZXRhY2Nlc3NrZXk=
```

Then, in your Docker Compose file, you can replace:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
```

with the encoded version of the file:

```yaml
  kestra:
    image: kestra/kestra:latest
    env_file:
      - .env_encoded
```
