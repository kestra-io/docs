Kestra is an open-source orchestrator designed to bring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices to all workflows â€” from those orchestrating mission-critical applications, IT operations, business processes, and data pipelines, to simple Zapier-style automations.

You can use Kestra to:
- run workflows **on-demand**, **event-driven** or based on a regular **schedule**
- programmatically interact with any system or programming language
- orchestrate **microservices**, **batch jobs**, ad-hoc **scripts** (written in Python, R, Julia, Node.js, and more), **SQL queries**, data ingestion syncs, dbt or Spark jobs, or any other **applications** or **processes**

This tutorial will guide you through **key concepts** in Kestra. We'll build upon the "Hello world" flow from the [Getting Started](../01.getting-started.md) section, and we'll gradually introduce new concepts including `namespaces`, `tasks`, parametrization with `inputs` and scheduling using `triggers`.

We'll then dive into `parallel` task execution, error handling, as well as custom scripts and microservices running in isolated containers. Let's get started!
