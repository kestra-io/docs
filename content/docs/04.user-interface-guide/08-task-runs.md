This feature requires a [commercial license](https://kestra.io/pricing) and backend with the **Elasticsearch** repository.
::

On the **Task Runs** page, you will see the list of task runs and some charts.

This page only exists when using the Elasticsearch repository, as it requires a full-text search engine.
