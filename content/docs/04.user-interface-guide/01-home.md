The first time you access the **Home** page, as no flows exist, the page will display something similar to the **Welcome Page** on which you can click **Create my first flow** to open the Kestra __Guided Tour__ which will guide you step by step into creating and executing your first flow.

After the creation of a flow and its execution, you will see a dashboard of flow executions.
