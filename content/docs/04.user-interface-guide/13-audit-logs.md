On the **Audit Logs** page, you will have access to all Kestra audit logs.

Audit logs record all activities made by all users on the resources created inside Kestra.

By reviewing audit logs, system administrators can track user activity, and security teams can investigate breaches and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
