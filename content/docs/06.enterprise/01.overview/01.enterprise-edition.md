## Key Features

Kestra Enterprise is built on top of the [Open Source Edition](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) but features a different architecture. Below are the key differences between the two.

⚡️**High Availability**: Kestra Enterprise is designed to be highly available and fault tolerant. It uses a **Kafka** cluster as a backend for event-driven orchestration and **Elasticsearch** for storing logs and metrics. This not only improves performance but also eliminates single points of failure and enables the system to scale for large workloads.

⚡️**Multi-Tenancy**: The Enterprise Edition supports multi-tenancy, enabling separate environments for different teams or projects. Each tenant is fully isolated and can have its own access control policies.

⚡️**Security and Access Control**: Kestra Enterprise supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), enabling you to integrate with your existing identity provider and manage user access to workflows and resources.

⚡️**Enterprise Features**: This edition of Kestra includes additional enterprise features such as Audit Logs, Worker Groups, Custom Blueprints, Namespace-level Secrets, Variables, and Plugin Defaults.

⚡️**Secrets Management**: Kestra Enterprise securely stores and manages secrets. It also supports integration with existing secret managers such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Elasticsearch, Google Secret Manager, and HashiCorp Vault.

⚡️**Support**: The Enterprise edition comes with guaranteed SLAs and priority support.

⚡️**Onboarding**: We provide onboarding and training for your team to help you get started quickly.
