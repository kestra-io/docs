How to setup Kestra Enterprise Edition.

The Setup instructions will guide you through the initial configuration of your instance.

When you launch Kestra Enterprise Edition for the first time, you will be prompted to configure your instance. This includes setting up your first tenant, creating your first user, and starting the Kestra UI.

## Step 1: Validate Configuration

The first screen shows the main configuration of your instance. It displays:
- whether `multitenancy` is enabled
- whether `default tenant` is enabled — if yes, you can skip the Step 2 allowing you to create your first tenant
- which `database` backend is configured (e.g., Postgres or Elasticsearch)
- which `queue` backend is configured (e.g., Postgres or Kafka)
- which `internal storage` backend is configured (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, Minio, or local storage)
- which `secret` backend is configured (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Elasticsearch, or not set up yet)

This step asks you to confirm whether your configuration is valid. If not, you can correct the configuration, restart the instance, and start the setup from scratch.

## Step 2: Create your first Tenant

If `multitenancy` is enabled, you will be prompted to create your first tenant.

If you choose to create a tenant, you will be asked to input the tenant id and tenant name, for example:
- tenant id: `stage`
- tenant name: `Staging Environment`.

If you enabled a default tenant, you can skip this step.

## Step 3: Create your first User

Now that you have your instance configured, you will be prompted to create your first user. This user will have a [Super-Admin](../03.auth/rbac.md#super-admin) role for the instance and will be able to manage tenants, users, and roles.

## Step 4: Start Kestra UI

Once your tenant and user are configured, you will be prompted to launch Kestra UI. This will direct you to the instance on the first tenant, logged in as the first user.
