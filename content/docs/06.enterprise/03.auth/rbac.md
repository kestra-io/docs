## Overview

Kestra Enterprise supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to manage access to workflows and resources by
assigning Roles to Users, Groups, and Service Accounts.

The image below shows the relationship between Users, Groups, Service Accounts, Roles, and Bindings (visible on the
Access page in the UI).

![bindings](/docs/enterprise/rbac.png)

## Roles and Bindings

A Role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to Users, Service Accounts, or Groups.\
Theses permissions are defined by a combination of a **Permission** (e.g., `FLOWS`) and an **Action** (
e.g., `CREATE`).

::collapse{title="More information"}

The **Role** itself does not grant any permissions to anyone.

Through the **Access** UI page, you are able to attach a Role to a User, Service Account, or Group, which creates a **Binding**.

This Binding grants the permissions defined by that Role to the User, Service Account, or Group.

A Binding can be optionally limited to specific namespaces. When a Binding is tied to a namespace, it automatically grants permissions to all child namespaces. For example, a Role attached to the `prod` namespace automatically grants access to the `prod.engineering` namespace as well.

Note that you can [configure a default role](../configuration/index.md#default-role) so that all new Users are automatically assigned that Role. This is especially useful to grant a default set of permissions to all new Users who join your Kestra instance via [SSO](./sso/index.md).

In short, Roles encapsulate permission boundaries that can be attached to Users, Service Accounts, or Groups across tenants and namespaces.
::

### Permissions

A Permission is a resource that can be accessed by a User or Group. Supported Permissions:
- `FLOW`
- `EXECUTION`
- `TEMPLATE`
- `NAMESPACE`
- `KVSTORE`
- `DASHBOARD`
- `USER`
- `GROUP`
- `ROLE`
- `BINDING`
- `AUDITLOG`
- `SECRET`
- `BLUEPRINT`
- `INFRASTRUCTURE`
- `IMPERSONATE`
- `SETTING`
- `APP`
- `APPEXECUTION`
- `ME`
- `APITOKEN`

::alert{type="warning"}
The `ME` and `APITOKEN` permissions were added in version 0.21.0. After upgrading to 0.21.0 or later, make sure to update any custom roles with these permissions as needed by the users. Any roles managed by Kestra that need these permissions have them automatically applied in the upgrade.
::

### Actions

An Action is a specific operation that can be performed on a Permission. Supported Actions:

- `CREATE`
- `READ`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

### Currently Supported Roles

Currently, Kestra only creates an **Admin** role by default. That role grants full access to **all resources**.

Apart from that, you can create additional Roles with custom permission combinations. You can create roles and select the permissions and actions in the **IAM - Roles** tab.

![role-creation](/docs/enterprise/role-creation.png)

## Super Admin and Admin

Kestra provides two roles for managing your instance: super admin and admin.

- Super Admin is a user type with elevated privileges for global control
- Admin is a customizable role that grants full access to all resources (scoped to a tenant if multi-tenancy is enabled).

::collapse{title="Summary"}
Here's a table summarizing the key differences between an Admin and a Super Admin:

| Feature                             | Admin (scoped to a tenant if enabled)              | Super Admin                                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Level                        | By default as all permissions, depends on the Role | Manages tenants and IAM across all tenants           |
| Tenant Management                   | No                                                 | Create/Update/Read/Delete tenants across all tenants |
| User/Role/Group/Bindings Management | Has the permission by default                      | Create/Update/Read/Delete across all tenants         |
| Flow/Execution Management           | Has the permission by default                      | No                                                   |
| Set Super Admin privilege           | No                                                 | Yes                                                  |

### Super Admin

Without any Role or Binding, Super Admin has access to manage tenants, users, roles, and groups within a Kestra Enterprise instance.


::collapse{title="More information"}

#### Use Cases

Super Admin is a powerful type of user. Use the role sparingly and only for use cases that require it, such as creating
a new tenant, troubleshooting tenant issues, or helping a user with a problem.

However, you should use Kestra through the role system.
::

::collapse{title="Creating a Super Admin"}

#### Through the UI

When you launch Kestra for the first time, if no prior action has been made through the CLI, you will be invited to setup Kestra through the [Setup Page](../01.overview/02.setup.md).

This interface invites you to create your first User which will be automatically assigned the `Super Admin` privilege.

#### Through the CLI

To create a User with a Super Admin privilege from the [CLI](../../ee-server-cli/index.md), use the `--superadmin` option:

```bash
kestra auths users create admin@kestra.io TopSecret42 --superadmin

# schema:
kestra auths users create <username> <password> \
--tenant=<tenant-id> --superadmin
```

#### Through the Configuration

A Super Admin can also be created from the configuration file using the configuration below:

```yaml
kestra:
  security:
    superAdmin:
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
      tenantAdminAccess:
        - <optional>
```

For more details, check the [Enterprise Edition Configuration](../../configuration/index.md#super-admin) page.

::

::collapse{title="Grant/Revoke Super Admin permissions"}

::alert{type="info"}
Note that you need to be a super admin yourself.
::

#### Through the UI

You can grant or revoke the Super Admin privilege using the switch in the User Edit page.

![superadmin switch](/docs/enterprise/superadmin_switch.png)

#### Through the CLI

To set an existing User with a Super Admin privilege from the [CLI](../../ee-server-cli/index.md), use the dedicated command:

```bash
# Set a user as Super Admin
kestra auths users set-type admin@kestra.io SUPER_ADMIN

# Revoke Super Admin privilege
kestra auths users set-type admin@kestra.io STANDARD
```

::

### Admin

In Kestra, the notion of Admin user does not exist; instead we create an **Admin** role with all permissions.

This role can be assigned to any User, Service Account, or Group. This allows you to have different types of admins, to grant admin permissions to a whole group, and to revoke those admin permissions at any time without having to delete any group or user.

When using multi-tenancy, Kestra assigns the Admin Role to the user who created the tenant by default.

::alert{type="info"}
If you see an error when creating a new User or Service Account, it might be caused by a limit on your license. In that case, [reach out to us](/contact-us) to validate and optionally upgrade your license.
::

::collapse{title="Creating a User with an Admin Role"}

####  Through the UI

When launching Kestra for the first time, if no prior action has been made through the CLI, you will be invited to setup Kestra through the [Setup Page](../01.overview/02.setup.md).

This interface invites you to create the first User which will automatically create the role Admin and bind the User to the role.

Later, you can create a new User or pick an existing User and assign the Admin role to it from the Access page.

#### Through the CLI

To create a User with an Admin Role from the CLI, use the `--admin` option:

```bash
kestra auths users create prod.admin@kestra.io TopSecret42 --admin

# schema:
kestra auths users create <username> <password> --admin
```

::

## Users, Groups and Service Accounts

In Kestra you will find three types of entities:

* Users: represents a **person**
* Groups: represents a collection of **Users** and **Service Accounts**
* Service Accounts: represents an **application**

All theses entities can be assigned to a Role, which define what resources the User, Group, or Service Account can access.

Note that these entities donâ€™t belong to namespaces, but their permissions can be limited to specific namespaces via Bindings (Access page).

::collapse{title="How to bind a role to a User, a Service Accounts or a Group?"}
Once you have created your first role. You can attach that role to an entity through the Access page. You can also limit that Role to one or more namespaces.

The following example show the creation of a Binding for a User. We are defining the User `john@doe.com` as an Admin for the `team.customer` namespace.

![create a binding](/docs/enterprise/create_binding.png)
::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** Service Accounts are considered as Users when binding.
::

::

::collapse{title="How many Roles can a User, a Service Account or Group have?"}
There is no limit to the number of Roles that can be bound to an entity. They can have zero, one, or more Roles attached, giving specific permissions, optionally tied to one or more namespaces.
::

::collapse{title="How to change the lockout behavior after too many failed login attempts."}
By default, Kestra >= 0.22 will lock the user for the `lock-duration` period after a `threshold` number of failed attempts performed within the `monitoring-window` duration. The snippet below lists the default values for those properties â€” you can adjust them based on your preferences:

```yaml
security:
  login:
    failed-attempts:
      threshold: 10
      monitoring-window: PT5M
      lock-duration: PT30M
```
The key attributes are:
- `threshold`: Sets the number of allowed failed attempts before a user is locked out.
- `monitoring-window`: Defines the period during which failed login attempts are counted before triggering a lock. Superadmin can unlock the user manually by resetting their password from the user's detail page.
- `lock-duration`: Defines how long the account remains locked.

In the above configuration, a user is allotted 10 failed login attempts in a 5-minute window before they are locked out. They must wait 30 minutes to try again, be unlocked by an Admin, or reset their password by clicking on the "Forgot password" link and following the instructions in the email.
::

### Users

A User represents a **person** who can access Kestra, identified by an email address. Each user might have personal
information attached to it, such as the first name or last name.

They can change their own password and adjust other settings such as theme, editor preferences,
timezone, and default namespace.

To add users to your Kestra instance, you can do one of the following:
- [Invite users](./invitations.md) to your instance or tenant from the UI
- Sync users from an external identity provider using SCIM
- Create users directly using Terraform

#### Change password

If a user wants to change their password, they can do it on their profile. This page can be accessed through the person icon in top right corner of the UI.
::collapse{title="Change password in the UI"}
![change_password](/docs/enterprise/change_password.png)
::

#### Reset password (by a Super Admin)

Kestra does not provide any "forgot password" feature yet. Currently only a super admin can update a user password through its User Edit page.

### Groups

Each `Group` is a collection of `Users` or `Service Accounts`.

- Each `User` can be assigned to zero, one, or more `Groups`.
- Each `Service Account` can also be assigned to zero, one, or more `Groups`.

Groups are a useful mechanism for providing the same roles to multiple Users or Service Accounts at once by binding a role to a Group.

#### What happens if you delete a Group?

All Users and Service Accounts assigned to that Group will lose permissions that were binds to the groups. However Users and Services Accounts will still exist.

## RBAC FAQ

::collapse{title="Why is Admin a Role rather than User type?"}

Admin role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to Users, Service Accounts, or Groups. This allows you to
grant multiple users with admin permissions if needed, and you can revoke only specific admin permissions at any time
without having to delete the user.

Admin roles can be assumed by multiple users or groups, and some user may be later granted a lower or a higher
permission boundary. In the same way, some user may initially be an Admin but then their permission may be revoked. The
Admin role enables all these patterns in a flexible way.

You can think of Users as **authentication** mechanism (who you are), and Roles as **authorization** mechanism (what you
are allowed to do). Decoupling authentication from authorization allows you to grant permissions to multiple users or
groups at once by attaching a single Role to a Group.
::

::collapse{title="Why can't I edit an existing Binding?"}

A Binding is an immutable object. If a Binding no longer reflects the desired permissions, you can delete the existing
Binding and create a new one for the same User, Service Account, or Group but with different Roles and/or namespaces.
This is a safety feature to prevent accidental changes to existing permissions.
