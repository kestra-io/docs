## What is an API token

API tokens are used to authenticate API requests to the Kestra API. You can create an API token for a user or a [service account](../06.enterprise/service-accounts.md).

## Where you can use API tokens

API tokens are used anytime you want to grant programmatic access to the Kestra API. To authenticate your custom API calls, you can pass a bearer token to the request header. For example, you can use API tokens to authenticate with the Kestra API from a CI/CD pipeline or from a custom application.

Currently, we support API tokens as authentication mechanism for the following services:
1. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kestra-io/deploy-action)
2. [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kestra-io/kestra/latest/docs)
3. [Kestra CLI](../../ee-server-cli/index.md)
4. [Kestra API](./api.md)

## How to create a User API token

To create an API token, navigate to the person icon in the top right corner of the Kestra UI and click on **Get a token**.

Once in your profile, click on **+ Create API Token** in the **Manage your API Tokens** section.

![create-api-token](/docs/enterprise/create-api-token.png)

Fill in the form with the required information including the `Name`, `Description`, and `Max age`. Once satisfied, click `Generate`:

::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** you can configure the token to expire after a certain period of time or to never expire. Also, there is a toggle called `Extended` that automatically prolongs the token's expiration date by the specified number of days (`Max Age`) if the token is actively used. That toggle is disabled by default.

Once you confirm the API token creation, the token will be generated and displayed in the UI. Make sure to copy the token and store it in a secure location as it will not be displayed again.

## How to create a Service Account API token

To create an API token for a Service Account, navigate to the `Administration` section and click on the `Service Accounts` page.

Then, go to the `API Tokens` tab and click on the `Create` button:

![api-token](/docs/enterprise/api-token.png)

Fill in the form with the required information including the `Name`, `Description`, and `Max age`. Once satisfied, click `Generate`:

![api-token2](/docs/enterprise/api-token2.png)

::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** same as for a user token, you can configure the token to expire after a certain period of time or to never expire. Also, there is a toggle called `Extended` that will automatically prolong the token's expiration date by the specified number of days (`Max Age`) if the token is actively used. That toggle is disabled by default.
::

Once you confirm the API token creation via the **Generate** button, the token will be generated and displayed in the UI. Make sure to copy the token and store it in a secure location as it will not be displayed again.

## How to use an API token in an API request

To authenticate your custom API calls, you can pass a `Bearer` token to the request's `Authorization` header. Here is an example that will trigger a flow execution using the Kestra API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/executions/dev/hello-world \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
