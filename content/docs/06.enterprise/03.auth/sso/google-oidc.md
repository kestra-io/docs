# Setting Up OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Google Identity Platform and Integrating with Kestra

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure **OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication using Google Identity Platform** and link it to [**Kestra Enterprise**](../../01.overview/index.md) for [Single Sign-On (SSO)](./index.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud Project**: Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
- **Administrator Access**: You need sufficient permissions to configure Identity Platform and manage identity providers.
- **Kestra Enterprise Edition**: Kestra SSO is available only in the Enterprise Edition.

Refer to the [Google OIDC setup documentation](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/web/oidc) for more details.

## Step 1: Enable Identity Platform in Google Cloud

1. **Navigate to the Identity Platform**:
   - Go to the [Identity Platform page](https://console.cloud.google.com/identity) in the Google Cloud Console.

2. **Confirm your project**:
    - Make sure that you have the correct project selected to add an identity provider to.

## Step 2: Add an OIDC Provider in Google Cloud

1. **Access Identity Providers**:
   - In the Identity Platform menu, select **Providers**.

2. **Add a New Provider**:

3. **Configure the OIDC Provider**:
   - **Grant type**: Select Code Flow grant type.
   - **Provider Name**: Enter a display name for the OIDC provider.
   - **Client ID**: Input the **Client ID** obtained from Google.
   - **Client Secret**: Input the **Client Secret** associated with the Client ID.
   - **Issuer URL**: Provide the **Issuer URL** (e.g., `https://accounts.google.com`).
   - **Scopes**: Specify any additional scopes required by your application.

## Step 3: Configure Kestra to Use Google as an OIDC SSO Provider

Now that Google is set up as an OIDC provider, we need to link it to Kestra.

1. **Navigate to the Kestra Configuration File**:
   - Locate Kestraâ€™s `yaml` configuration file.

2. **Add the OIDC Settings**:
   - Add the following configuration to enable Google as an OIDC provider for Kestra:

```yaml
 micronaut:
  security:
    oauth2:
      enabled: true
      clients:
        google:
          client-id: "{{ clientId }}"
          client-secret: "{{ clientSecret }}"
          openid:
            issuer: 'https://accounts.google.com'
```
- Replace `clientId` and `clientSecret` with the values from Google Identity Platform.
- Update redirectUri with your Kestra instance URL.
- Restart Kestra to apply the changes.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up OIDC authentication using Google Identity Platform, allowing users to sign in with their existing credentials from your chosen OIDC provider.
