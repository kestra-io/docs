## Bugfix Releases

Every **Thursday**, we release a new bugfix version for the `latest` release. This means that if you are using the latest version of Kestra, you can expect a new bugfix release every week. You can track which GitHub issues are planned for the next bugfix release in our public [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/kestra-io/projects/15/views/25).

We recommend regularly updating to the `latest` version to benefit from the most recent bug fixes and security patches.

## Backport Releases

Regardless of the Kestra version you are using, we provide backport releases to Enterprise customers upon request. If you submit a ticket to our support team, we will provide a backport release with the necessary bug fixes for your specific version.

The backport releases are provided on a best-effort basis to our Enterprise customers. We still recommend upgrading to the latest version to continuously benefit from the latest improvements and security updates.

## Upgrade Support

If you have questions or need help upgrading to the latest version of Kestra EE, please contact our [support team](/demo/).
