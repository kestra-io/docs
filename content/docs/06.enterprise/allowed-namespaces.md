How to manage cross-namespace permissions in the Enterprise Edition.

When you navigate to any Namespace and go to the Edit tab, you can explicitly configure which namespaces are allowed to access flows and other resources related to that namespace. By default, all namespaces are allowed:

![allowed-namespaces](/docs/enterprise/allowed-namespaces.png)

However, you can restrict that access if you want only specific namespaces (or no namespace at all) to trigger its corresponding resources.
