## How to create an announcement

To add a custom in-app banner, go to the **Administration → Instance → Announcements** tab.

As a user with an Admin role, you can configure the following within each announcement:

- `Message`: the text to display in the banner
- `Type`: the type of banner to display (`info`, `warning`, `error`)
- The `start` and `end` date during which the announcement should be displayed.
