## Our Story 

![Create flow](/docs/tutorial/logos/our-story.png)

When we created Kestra, our ambition was to design a simple yet powerful and fast  orchestration platform. We wanted to enable our clients to manage complex flows with the same agility as a conductor who leads a  symphony. This is how our logo was born, which embodies Kestraâ€™s ability to orchestrate multiple tasks simultaneously.
