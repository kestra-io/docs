Bug reports help us make Kestra better for everyone. We provide a preconfigured template for bugs to make it very clear what information we need.
Please search within our [already reported bugs](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

### Reporting security issues
Please do not create a public GitHub issue. If you've found a security issue, please email us directly at [hello@kestra.io](mailto:hello@kestra.io) instead of raising an issue.


### Requesting new features
To request new features, please create an issue on this project.
If you would like to suggest a new feature, we ask that you please use our issue template. It contains a few essential questions that help us understand the problem you are looking to solve and how you think your recommendation will address it.
To see what has already been proposed by the community, you can look [here](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).
Watch out for duplicates! If you are creating a new issue, please check existing open, or recently closed. Having a single voted for issue is far easier for us to prioritize.
