title: Kestra
---

#### Requirements
The following dependencies are required to build Kestra locally:
- Java 17+, Kestra runs on Java 11 but we hit a Java compiler bug fixed in Java 17
- Node 14+ and npm
- Python 3, pip and python venv
- Docker & Docker Compose
- an IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse or VS Code)

To start contributing:
- [Fork](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/fork) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/kestra.git
$ cd kestra
```

#### Develop backend
The backend is made with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io).

Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE. In many IDEs, Gradle build will be detected and all dependencies will be downloaded.
You can also build it from a terminal using `./gradlew build`, the Gradle wrapper will download the right Gradle version to use.

- You may need to enable Java annotation processors since we are using it a lot.
- The main class is `io.kestra.cli.App` from module `kestra.cli.main`
- Pass as program arguments the server you want to develop, for example `server standalone` will start a [standalone Kestra server](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/servers/#kestra-standalone-development-environment-servers).
- The Intellij Idea configuration can be found in screenshot below:
![Intellij Idea Configuration ](/docs/contribution/standalone.png)
  - `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS`: can be set any string and will load a custom configuration file in `cli/src/main/resources/application-{env}.yml`.
  - `KESTRA_PLUGINS_PATH`: is the path where you will save plugins as Jar and will be loaded during the startup process.
- You can also use the gradle task `./gradlew runStandalone` that will run a standalone server with `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=override` and plugins path `local/plugins`
- The server start by default on port 8080 and is reachable on `http://localhost:8080`.

If you want to launch all tests, you need Python and some packages installed on your machine. On Ubuntu, you can install them with the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3 pip python3-venv
$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```


#### Develop frontend
The frontend is made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and located in the `/ui` folder.

```shell
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```
- Create a file `ui/.env.development.local` with the content `VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080` (or your actual server URL).

- You can serve the UI with hot reload at http://localhost:5173 using the command: `npm run dev`. For a production build, use: `npm run build`.

- If you have CORS restrictions when using the local development npm server, you need to configure the backend to allow the http://localhost:5173 origin in `cli/src/main/resources/application-override.yml` using the following addition to your kestra configuration YAML definition:

```yaml
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        all:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://localhost:5173
```

#### Develop plugins
A complete documentation for developing a plugin can be found in the [Plugin Developer Guide](../10.plugin-developer-guide/index.md).
