Browse [Kestra's integrations](/plugins) and learn how to create your own plugins.

Plugins are the building blocks of Kestra's tasks and triggers. They encompass components interacting with external systems and performing the actual work in your flows.

Kestra comes with a set of [built-in plugins](https://kestra.io/plugins), and you can also develop your own custom plugins. Check the [plugin developer guide](../10.plugin-developer-guide/index.md) to learn how to create a custom plugin, and

Check the [Plugin library](../plugins/index.md) for documentation of all tasks and triggers.

## Custom Plugins

Kestra allows you to create your own plugins to integrate with your own systems and processes. You can also contribute your plugins to the open-source community. If you think it could be useful to others, consider [contributing it](contributing.md) to our open-source community.

To create a new plugin, make sure to use the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template), as it comes prepackaged with everything you need for building your plugins. That template will create a project hosting a group of plugins, as we usually create multiple subplugins for a technology or use case. For example, while only one plugin exists for AWS, there are multiple subplugins for specific AWS services.

Note that plugin and subplugin **versions** must be aligned with your Kestra instance. You may encounter validation issues during flow creation (e.g. `Invalid bean` response with status 422) when some subplugins are on older Kestra version. In that case, you may want to update the file `plugin-yourplugin/gradle.properties` and set the `version` property to the correct Kestra snapshot e.g.:

```
version=0.13.0-SNAPSHOT
kestraVersion=[0.13,)
```

Then rebuild and/or publish the plugin.

### Requirements
Kestra plugins development requirements are:
* [Java](https://java.com) 17 or later.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (or any other Java IDE, we provide only help for IntelliJ IDEA).
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (included most of the time with the IDE).


### Create a new plugin

Here are the steps:

1. Go on the [plugin-template](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-template) repository.
2. Click on *Use this template*.
3. Choose the github account your want to link and the repository name for the new plugin.
4. Clone the new repository: `git clone git@github.com:{{user}}/{{name}}.git`.
5. Open the cloned directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
6. Enable [annotations processors](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html).
7. If you are using an IntelliJ IDEA < 2020.03, install the [lombok plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok) (if not, it's included by default).


Done! You are ready to create a new plugin, here is the directory structure you will have:
![Structure](/docs/plugin-developer-guide/plugins-architecture.png)

As you can see, there is one generated plugin: the `Example` class representing the `Example` plugin (a task).
A project typically hosts multiple plugins. We call a project a group of plugins, and you can have multiple sub-groups inside a project by splitting plugins into different packages. Each package that has a plugin class is a sub-group of plugins.
