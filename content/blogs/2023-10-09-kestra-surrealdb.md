If you're entering the world of data engineering and data orchestration in 2023, boy do you have options. So many actually that it's overwhelming at times, especially when looking for a database vendor.

Do you go with a traditional relational approach? How about storing documents? Graphs would be nice too. Can you have all of that and more with a single database? Well, according to **[SurrealDB](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb)**, you absolutely can.

Because of these reasons (any many more), we've developed a Kestra SurrealDB plugin that allows you to interact with the database in easy and convenient format.

Today's article will give you a primer in SurrealDB - an innovative NewSQL multi-model cloud database suitable for just anything you can imagine, but also show you how to work with it in [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra).
Let's dig in!

## What is SurrealDB and How to Get Started
*This portion of the article goes over the basics of SurrealDB - from installation to fundamental queries. Feel free to skip it if you're familiar with the topic.*

Think of [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) as an innovative NewSQL database solution that's suitable for serverless apps, jamstack apps, single-page apps, and can be deployed on cloud, on-premise, embedded, and edge-computing devices.
The database packs a wide array of disruptive features, such as an SQL-style query language, real-time queries with efficient related data retrieval, advanced security permissions for multi-tenant access, and superb support for performant analytical workloads.

**Some find it to be the next generation of a serverless database.**

Further, SurrealDB is a multi-model database, which means you can store your data in tables, documents, and graphs. You don't have to choose the method in advance. It allows you to add inter-document record links which results in completely avoiding traditional SQL JOINs. 

This database also has machine learning and real-time functionalities built in, but that's out of the scope of today's article.

You can find out more on the [official page](https://surrealdb.com/).

### How to Install SurrealDB
If we're talking about a local installation of SurrealDB, you'll be pleased to know that Windows, Linux, and macOS are all supported. You can also run it with Docker.

We'll show you how to install it on Mac. Feel free to consult the [official installation guide](https://surrealdb.com/docs/installation) for other operating systems.

Open up a new Terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

Yup, that's all you need to do - SurrealDB is now installed:

![Image 1 - Installing SurrealDB](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/2.png)

It's a good idea to add it to PATH while you're here - the output shown in the previous image lists the command you have to run. Here's the one generated for me - but remember that yours will be different:

```bash
PATH=/Users/dradecic/.surrealdb:$PATH
```

You'll probably how to open a **new Terminal session** to continue. Run the following command to check the database version you have installed:

```bash
surreal version
```

Provided you don't get an error (surreal not found), you're good to go:

![Image 2 - Checking the database version](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/3.png)

The database is now installed, but isn't running yet.

### How to Start SurrealDB

To start SurrealDB locally, you can use the `surreal start memory` command, followed by the authentication credentials for your user. We'll keep things simple and set both to `root`:

```bash
surreal start memory -A --auth --user root --pass root
```

You'll see the following output in the Terminal:

![Image 3 - Starting the database](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/4.png)

SurrealDB is now running locally, which means we should be able to connect to it.

### How to Establish a Connection to SurrealDB
A recommended GUI for SurrealDB is [Surrealist.app](https://surrealist.app/). It's a web application you can use for free, but **we couldn't establish a database connection through it**.

A [dedicated desktop application](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/Surrealist/releases) solved the connection issue. Install it, open it, and create a new session with the following details:
- *Endpoint URL*: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- *Namespace*: test
- *Database*: test
- *Authentication mode*: Root authentication
- *Username*: root
- *Password*: root

Here's what you should see on the screen:

![Image 4 - SurrealDB connection parameters](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/5.png)

Once you enter the connection parameters, hit the "Save details" button. You'll be redirected to the following screen:

![Image 5 - Database connection established](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/6.png)

As soon as you see the pink "Send query" button, and not the gray "Connect" button, it means the database connection was established, and you're ready to proceed to the following section.


## SurrealDB Basics: How to Create and Query Records
*If you're already familiar with SurrealDB, feel free to skip this section - it will only cover the basics.*

SurrealDB uses SurrealQL - a powerful query language similar to traditional SQL, but with some differences and improvements. We'll keep things light today, which means you don't have to go and watch a SurrealQL crash course to follow. If you understand basic SQL, you're good to continue.

### How to Insert New Records
Let's start by adding a couple of records to our database. You don't have to create a table schema beforehand. You are able to add records to the database directly.

The following code snippet shows you how to use the `CREATE` command to create a new record of type `employee` with a couple of fields:

```sql
CREATE employee SET
    first_name = 'John',
    last_name = 'Doe',
    email = 'jdoe@company.com',
    department = 'IT',
    created_date = time::now()
;

CREATE employee SET
    first_name = 'Jane',
    last_name = 'Janeson',
    email = 'jjaneson@company.com',
    department = 'Sales',
    created_date = time::now()
;
```

This will give an arbitrary ID to each record. If you want to control the ID value, create the record by writing `CREATE employee:<id>` instead.

Anyway, run the `CREATE` statements individually, and here's what you will see:

![Image 6 - Inserting records into SurrealDB](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/7.png)

The records should now be inserted into the database, but how can we know for sure? Let's query it next.

### How to Query Records
If you have at least 3 minutes of traditional SQL experience, you'll know what the `SELECT` statement does. It works exactly the same in SurrealDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

You can see both records listed in JSON format:

![Image 7 - Retrieving data from SurrealDB](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/8.png)

You now know the bare minimum of SurrealDB, but just enough to explore how it works with Kestra. We'll go over two simple data flows next, and only then will we go over a more advanced example.


## SurrealDB and Kestra: How to Get Started
We assume you already have [Kestra installed](https://medium.com/geekculture/introducing-kestra-finally-a-viable-airflow-alternative-fa664fdc7a0d) and are familiar with the user interface. The rest of the article won't dive into advanced Kestra features, so you should still be comfortable following it even if you're new.

### Flow #1: Retrieve Data from SurrealDB
The latest version of Kestra comes with a SurrealDB plugin you can access through `io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query`. It's used to run SurrealQL commands, and expects you to provide values of the QL statement along with the database connection information.

The neat part about Kestra is that you can use `taskDefaults` to set default values for a certain type of plugin. It's a good idea to use it, especially if you plan to use one plugin type multiple times.

To start, go under "Flows" and create a new flow. Paste the following code:

```yaml
id: surreal-flow
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: selectFromSurreal
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM employee;
    fetchType: STORE

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    values:
      host: host.docker.internal
      database: test
      namespace: test
      username: root
      password: root
```

Long story short, we're running a simple `SELECT` statement and storing all of the records in a file (`fetchType: STORE`). The `taskDefaults` section provides a default set of reusable values for the SurrealDB plugin, which are the database connection parameters.

Note how we're using host: `host.docker.internal` instead of the local database address. That's because we're running Kestra in a Docker container, and this is a workaround to allow it access to your computer's local host:

![Image 8 - First Kestra/SurrealDB flow](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/9.png)

Once your flow looks like ours, hit the "Save" button followed by "New execution".

You'll be redirected to a flow run Gantt chart in which you'll hopefully see the single bar colored green (which means success):

![Image 9 - Flow execution](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/10.png)

Remember how we specified `fetchType: STORE` in the flow code? What this means is that the records fetched from the SurrealDB will be accessible to you as a downloadable artifact.

Head over to the "Outputs" section of the execution log, and you'll be able to both preview and download the file:

![Image 10 - Downloadable result files](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/11.png)

This is what it contains:

![Image 11 - File contents](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/12.png)

And that's your first Kestra and SurrealDB flow. Let's also see how to insert data.

### Flow #2: Insert and Retrieve Data with SurrealDB
To insert and retrieve data with Kestra and SurrealDB you'll simply want to add yet another task with the type of `io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query`.

There's nothing to save here, so you can remove the `fetchType` argument. The only other change is the one you need to make to `query`. Leverage the knowledge from the previous section to write a simple `CREATE` statement with SurrealQL:

```yaml
id: surreal-flow
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: insertToSurreal
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      CREATE employee SET
        first_name = 'Bob',
        last_name = 'Deal',
        email = 'bdeal@company.com',
        department = 'Marketing',
        created_date = time::now()
      ;

  - id: selectFromSurreal
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM employee;
    fetchType: STORE

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    values:
      host: host.docker.internal
      database: test
      namespace: test
      username: root
      password: root
```

Here's what your flow code should look like:

![Image 12 - Second Kestra/SurrealDB flow](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/13.png)

Run it once again - this time, you'll see two bars, each representing an individual task:

![Image 13 - Flow execution](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/14.png)

The output artifact now has three records, since we've inserted a new one and fetched all of them:

![Image 14 - Flow output file contents](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/15.png)

Up next, let's work with a couple of "advanced" SurrealDB features to show you exactly what this database is capable of.


## Kestra and SurrealDB: Working with Advanced SurrealDB Features

Here's the thing about SurrealDB - it's really, really versatile, especially for creating new records. This section will show you how to:
- Control the ID value of a record
- Use various string functions such as `lowercase()` and `concat()` to create derived attributes (attributes based on other attributes)
- Use time functions to work with date and time
-Add nested JSON structure to your records
- Link records with another "table"
- Use `WHERE` and `FETCH` when running `SELECT` statements

Here's a more detailed description.

We'll modify the flow in a way that it uses three tasks of type `io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query`. Here's what each task will do:

**Task 1 - createEmployee**
- Creates a new type of record called `employee` and insert a new record with the ID of `dario` (my first name)
- Uses the dot notation in attribute names to leverage a nested JSON structure (e.g., `name.first` will equal to `"name": {"first": "value"}` 
- Creates a derived attribute of full name by combining the existing attributes for first and last name. This is done with the built-in `string::join()` function
- Creates a derived attribute for email that concatenates the lowercased values of first and last names, alongside the dot in between and a domain name after (more SurrealDB string functions)
- Creates a field named `year_of_birth` which is derived from an existing attribute age

**Task 2 - createLaptop**
- Creates a new type of record called `laptop` which will be linked with `employee`
- Uses a dot notation to leverage a nested JSON structure (explained earlier)
- Sets the `owner` attribute to `employee:dario` - essentially links these two records
- Fetches the ID property from the corresponding `employee` record

**Task 3 - getData**
- Runs your everyday `SELECT` statement
- Uses `WHERE` to filter out records based on `year_of_birth` (does nothing in this case since there's only one record)
- Uses `FETCH` to combine `employee` and `laptop` records
- Saves the result in a downloadable file

Everything described so far sounds like a lot, but it actually takes more time to describe the functionality with words than it does to implement it in code.

Here's the full contents of the YAML flow file:

```yaml
id: surreal-flow
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: createEmployee
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      CREATE employee:dario SET
          name.first = 'Dario',
          name.last = 'Radecic',
          name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
          email = string::concat(
              string::lowercase(name.first),
              '.',
              string::lowercase(name.last),
              '@company.com'
          ),
          age = 26,
          year_of_birth = time::year() - age,
          created_at = time::now()
      ;

  - id: createLaptop
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      CREATE laptop SET
          name = "MacBook Air M2",
          specs.cpu = "Apple M2 8-core",
          specs.gpu = "Apple M2 8-core",
          specs.ram = 8,
          specs.ssd = 256,
          owner = employee:dario,
          employee = (SELECT VALUE id FROM employee WHERE email = 'dario.radecic@company.com' LIMIT 1)[0]
      ;

  - id: getData
    type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    query: |
      SELECT * FROM employee, laptop 
      WHERE employee.year_of_birth >= 1995 
      FETCH employee, laptop
      ;
    fetchType: STORE

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.surrealdb.Query
    values:
      host: host.docker.internal
      database: test
      namespace: test
      username: root
      password: root
```

Let's run the flow to see what happens. We don't get any errors, indicated with the individual green bars:

![Image 15 - Third flow execution chart](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/16.png)

The downloadable file contains entries from both `employee` and `laptop`, as you can see from the following image:

![Image 16 - Resulting file](/blogs/2023-10-09-kestra-surrealdb/17.png)

And that's how Kestra integrates with SurrealDB - let's wrap things up next.

## Summing up Kestra and SurrealDB
Kestra's plugin library grows by the day, and every [new release](https://kestra.io/blogs/2023-09-28-release-0-12-subflow-logs-docker-builds-aws-lambda) packs a ton of features attractive to both individual and [enterprise users](https://kestra.io/enterprise). Combine that with the fact that you don't have to stick to a programming language to write and schedule data flows, and you'll get the idea of why more and more users are switching from competing data platforms.

Today's article showed you how simple the integration with SurrealDB is, and how it's actually faster to write the code than it is to describe the functionalities in plain English - especially with the last example.
