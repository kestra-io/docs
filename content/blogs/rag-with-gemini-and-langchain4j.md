Generative AI tools are great. However, relying purely on generative models can lead to outputs that feel generic, inaccurate, or outdated. This is where **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** comes in, combining the creativity of Generative AI with real-time, accurate context sourced from custom data.

We just introduced the [Langchain4J plugin](/plugins/plugin-langchain4j) that allows users to create complex Generative AI workflows in an AI provider-agnostic way. This plugin also provides all the tasks needed to create a RAG pipeline.

In this post, you'll learn how to build an advanced RAG pipeline using Google Gemini AI and Kestra’s new Langchain4J plugin, which leverages precise, context-aware AI generation. We'll cover document ingestion, embedding creation, retrieval strategies, and finally, demonstrate a full end-to-end RAG example.

## Create Powerful AI Workflows with Kestra’s Langchain4J

The new [Langchain4J plugin](/plugins/plugin-langchain4j) simplifies the implementation of RAG by handling document ingestion, embedding creation, retrieval, and generation tasks.

Here's a high-level overview of the workflows you'll create:

- **Document Ingestion and Embedding Creation:** You’ll ingest documents, split them into manageable segments, and generate embeddings.
- **Embedding Storage:**  Store embeddings in a vector store, optimizing retrieval.
- **Retrieval and Augmented Generation:** Build workflows that retrieve the most relevant embeddings based on user prompts and generate context-rich, accurate responses with Gemini AI.

## Create Embeddings through Document Ingestion

The first step is to create embeddings based on our own document. These embeddings will be stored to be retrieved later at generation time.

But first, what is an embedding?

To ingest a document, you split it into segments and call an embedding AI model for each segment, transforming each into a vector representation stored in an embedding store, typically a vector database. Simply put, an embedding is a vector representation of a segment of a document.

The `io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.rag.IngestDocument` task will do this for you!

```yaml
id: ingest-documents
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: ingest
    type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.rag.IngestDocument
    provider: #1
      type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini
      modelName: gemini-embedding-exp-03-07
      apiKey: "{{secret('GEMINI_API_KEY')}}"
    embeddings: #2
      type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.embeddings.KestraKVStore
    fromExternalURLs: #3
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/docs/refs/heads/main/content/blogs/release-0-22.md
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/docs/refs/heads/main/content/blogs/release-0-21.md
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/docs/refs/heads/main/content/blogs/release-0-20.md
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kestra-io/docs/refs/heads/main/content/blogs/release-0-19.md
    drop: true #4
```

1. We use the `io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini` model provider to use the embedding model from **Google Gemini**. We must use the same model at generation time. Kestra supports many large language models (LLM), and more will be supported soon.
2. We use the `io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.embeddings.KestraKVStore` embedding store. This is a convenient store that will store embeddings inside a [KeyValue store](https://kestra.io/doc/concepts/kv-store) and load them all in memory at generation time. For a large number of documents, you would typically use a vector database instead, like PGVector or Elasticsearch.
3. We use `fromExternalURLs` to define a list of documents to ingest from external URLs; here, the blog posts for Kestra releases 0.19 to 0.22. We will go into detail for other ways to define documents to ingest later.
4. We use `drop: true` to recreate the embedding store each time the flow is executed.

After executing the flow, you will be able to see a new KV store entry with the serialized form of the computed embeddings.

### Define documents from multiple sources

Depending on your use case, you can use different task properties to define documents from multiple types of sources:
- `fromPath`: from a working directory path, usually used in tandem with a [WorkingDirectory](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/flow/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.workingdirectory) task, each file in the directory will create a document.
- `fromInternalURIs`: from a list of internal storage URIs.
- `fromExternalURLs`: from a list of external URLs.
- `fromDocuments`: from a list of documents defined inside the task itself.

Document metadata allows the defining of additional information to the large language model. Some metadata is automatically added to documents at ingestion time, such as the URL of the document if using `fromExternalURLs` or the name of the file if using `fromPath`.
You can set additional metadata via the `metadata` property.

### Advanced document splitting

Documents are split into segments to feed the large language model. Document splitting is an important step, as each segment will create an embedding vector, so the embedding retrieval performance and accuracy will depend on how you split the documents.

By default, we split documents using a `RECURSIVE` splitter that tries to split documents into paragraphs first and fits as many paragraphs into a single text segment as possible. If some paragraphs are too long, they are recursively split into lines, then sentences, then words, and then characters until they fit into a segment. This is usually a good strategy, but you can specifically declare to split at the `PARAGRAPH`, `LINE`, `SENTENCE`, or `WORD` level as needed.

When splitting, you can define the maximum size of the segments using the `maxSegmentSizeInChars` property and the maximum size of the overlap to feed a full sentence into a segment even if it overlaps the maximum segment size using the `maxOverlapSizeInChars` property.

Here is an example that splits documents by paragraph only and with a maximum size of 4KB.

```yaml
id: ingest-documents
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: ingest
    type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.rag.IngestDocument
    # [...]
    documentSplitter:
      splitter: PARAGRAPH
      maxSegmentSizeInChars: 4096
```

## Retrieval augmented generation

This second flow will use the embedding store created by the first flow to retrieve documents based on the prompt passed into the flow inputs and use these documents to augment the large language model contextual information. The flow components are described in detail below and designated by a numbered comment in the YAML.

```yaml
id: rag-completion
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: prompt
    type: STRING
    defaults: What's new in Kestra 0.22?

tasks:
  - id: completion
    type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.rag.Chat
    embeddings: #1
      type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.embeddings.KestraKVStore
      kvName: ingest-documents-embedding-store
    chatProvider: #2
      type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini
      modelName: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
      apiKey: "{{secret('GEMINI_API_KEY')}}"
    embeddingProvider: #3
      type: io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini
      modelName: gemini-embedding-exp-03-07
      apiKey: "{{secret('GEMINI_API_KEY')}}"
    contentRetrieverConfiguration: #4
      maxResults: 3
      minScore: 0.5
    prompt: "{{ inputs.prompt }}" #5
```

1. Here, we're using the same embedding store used in the `ingest-documents` flow. We must set the name of the KV entry, as we are not in the same flow, and the name of the KV entry is, by default, the name of the flow suffixed by `embedding-store`.
2. We're using the `io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini` large language model provider configured to use the Google Gemini Flash 2.5 model.
3. We're using the `io.kestra.plugin.langchain4j.provider.GoogleGemini` large language model provider for embeddings; this must be the same as the one used to ingest documents into the embedding store.
4. We configure the content retriever to return three results and filter them with a minimal score of 0.5 to avoid having inaccurate results returned by the embedding store.
5. The prompt sent to the large language model for completion.

We use the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model. This model is convenient for such use cases as it has a large context window of one million tokens. This is important for retrieval augmented generation, as retrieved documents will be added to the context window.
This model is also cost-effective and quick to answer, making it a good fit for automated workflows.

If you execute this flow with the default prompt, it will answer something like the following:

```markdown
Kestra 0.22 introduces several powerful new features and enhancements focused on enterprise-grade management, developer experience, and new plugin capabilities.

Here's what's new in Kestra 0.22:

[...].
```

We'll spare you the long list of 0.22 features here, but if you missed it, they can be seen in the [0.22 blog post](https://kestra.io/blogs/release-0-22). Or, take the example above with your own Gemini API Key and enjoy the results!

Moving on, even more interestingly, we can ask it for information across documents and include its sources!

For example, try the following prompt: `What are the most interesting new features in Kestra? Include your sources with links.`

It should answer something like the response below, with the source of each new feature!

```markdown
Kestra has introduced several interesting new features across its recent releases (0.20, 0.21, and 0.22), focusing on enhancing enterprise-grade management, developer experience, and operational capabilities.

Here are some of the most interesting new features:

1.  **Apps: Custom UIs for Your Flows (Kestra 0.20)**
    This feature allows users to build custom interfaces for interacting with Kestra workflows. It democratizes access to workflows by providing simple forms, output displays, and approval buttons, enabling non-technical business users to trigger, pause, or submit data to automated processes without needing to understand the underlying code. Flows act as the backend, while Apps serve as the frontend.
    *   **Source:** [Kestra 0.20 adds SLAs, Invites, User-Facing Apps, Isolated Storage and Secrets per Team, and Transactional Queries](https://kestra.io/blogs/2024-12-03-release-0-20#apps)

[...]
```

### How it works

The prompt is first used to create an embedding vector. This vector will be used to search for the most relevant segments in the embedding store. Here, we ask that three documents be retrieved with a minimal score of 0.5.

Then, these documents are sent into the context window of the LLM with the prompt for generation.

At ingestion time, each document will be indexed with metadata, including the document URL, as the external URLs property retrieved it. The LLM can then include these URLs as the source of the information used for the generation.

## Conclusion

RAG significantly enhances generative AI, providing context-rich, accurate, and up-to-date responses tailored to your specific data. With Kestra’s Langchain4J plugin and Google Gemini, building AI workflows becomes straightforward and effective.
