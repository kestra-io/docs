Automation focuses on the execution of tasks—triggering scripts, transferring data, or running jobs. Orchestration, however, operates at a higher level: coordinating these tasks, defining dependencies, and ensuring everything flows across systems and teams.
Despite its potential, orchestration tools often overlook a crucial aspect: accessibility. Most platforms cater exclusively to developers, leaving non-technical users with limited visibility and fragmented solutions to perform their part in the workflow. The result? Silos, manual workarounds, and missed opportunities to maximize automation’s value.
Kestra Apps change this.

By introducing a layer of self-service interfaces on top of orchestrated workflows, Kestra Apps make orchestration accessible to everyone. Developers retain full control of the backend processes, while end-users—regardless of technical expertise—can interact directly with workflows through intuitive forms, approval buttons, or output dashboards.

Kestra Apps bridge the gap between technical orchestration and practical usability, enabling true collaboration across teams and simplifying even the most complex workflows.

This blog dives into how Kestra Apps bring workflows closer to your teams. From simplifying file uploads to enabling dynamic data requests, we’ll explore practical examples and how Apps make automation accessible to everyone.

## Requests & Review

Uploading files to an FTP server—still a thing, right? But doing it securely and efficiently? That’s where the pain begins.
Kestra Apps simplify it all. Instead of dealing with credentials, server configurations, or outdated UIs, users can select their FTP configuration, choose a folder, and upload their file with a single click.
Automation shouldn’t feel manual. With Apps, workflows handle the complexity while users get an experience that makes sense.

With Apps we can build a simple frontend allowing users to upload a file, selecting the FTP configuration they want and the folder to simply upload files without the worry of credentials inputs, server configuration, or old designed UI.

```yaml
id: upload_ftp
namespace: company

inputs:

  - id: file
    displayName: File
    type: FILE

  - id: folder
    displayName: FTP Folder
    type: STRING

  - id: file_name
    displayName: Filename in the FTP
    type: STRING
    description: What will be the file name in the FTP?
    defaults: "data.csv"

  - id: ftp_config
    type: SELECT
    values:
      - FTP Company
      - FTP Shiny Rocks
      - FTP Internal

tasks:
  - id: switch
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Switch
    value: "{{ inputs.ftp_config }}"
    cases:
      "FTP Company":
        - id: ftp_company
          type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.ftp.Upload
          host: ftp://ftp.company.com
          port: 21
          username: "{{ secret('FTP_COMPANY_USER')}}"
          password: "{{ secret('FTP_COMPANY_PASSWORD') }}"
          from: "{{ inputs.file }}"
          to: "{{inputs.folder}}/{{inputs.file_name}}"
          
      "FTP Shiny Rocks":
        - id: ftp_shiny
          type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.ftp.Upload
          host: ftp://ftp.shiny.com
          port: 21
          username: "{{ secret('FTP_SHINY_USER')}}"
          password: "{{ secret('FTP_SHINY_PASSWORD') }}"
          from: "{{ inputs.file }}"
          to: "{{inputs.folder}}/{{inputs.file_name}}"

      "FTP Internal":
        - id: ftp_internal
          type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.ftp.Upload
          host: ftp://ftp.internal.com
          port: 21
          username: "{{ secret('FTP_INTERNAL_USER')}}"
          password: "{{ secret('FTP_INTERNAL_PASSWORD') }}"
          from: "{{ inputs.file }}"
          to: "{{inputs.folder}}/{{inputs.file_name}}"

    defaults:
      - id: default
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
        errorMessage: "Please choose an existing FTP configuration"
```

This example is one of the many one can imagine! Providing a simple interface for any users to request infrastructure deployment, file access, days off for holiday, etc. There are tons of cases where these need custom specifications and underlying automation.

Kestra already made easy connection with any system. It now provides the key to build custom interface on top of these automations.


## Dynamic Self-Serve

Sometimes you build dashboards. Tons of dashboards. But data consumers often crave something more flexible—a dynamic interface where they can craft their own analysis by tweaking dimensions, measures, and parameters on the fly.

We can build an app that will bound such request while allowing users to play with parameters. 

For example, let's take a parametized query allowing us to aggregate some data over time. The end user might want to download trends for different dimension and measures alongside a specific time frame.

Such workflow can be easily setup in Kestra, like this:

```yaml
id: query_analysis
namespace: kestra.weather

inputs:
  - id: dimension
    type: SELECT
    values:
      - city
      - region
      - country

  - id: start_date
    type: DATETIME

  - id: end_date
    type: DATETIME

tasks:
  - id: query
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql.Query
    sql: |
      SELECT
        _{{ inputs.dimension }} AS city,
        DATE(_time) AS date_time,
        AVG(_temperature) AS avg_temperature
      FROM weather.staging_temperature
      WHERE
        _time BETWEEN '{{ inputs.start_date}}' AND '{{ inputs.end_date }}'
      GROUP BY _{{ inputs.dimension }}, DATE(_time)
    store: true

  - id: ion_to_csv
    type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.IonToCsv
    from: "{{ outputs.query.uri }}"

  - id: chart
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    inputFiles:
      data.csv: "{{ outputs.ion_to_csv.uri }}"
    outputFiles:
      - "plot.png"
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install pandas
      - pip install plotnine
    script: |
      import pandas as pd
      from plotnine import ggplot, geom_col, aes, ggsave

      data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
      print(data.head())
      plot = (
          ggplot(data) + 
          geom_col(aes(x="date_time", fill="city", y="avg_temperature"), position="dodge")
      )
      ggsave(plot, "plot.png")

outputs:
  - id: plot
    type: FILE
    value: '{{ outputs.chart["outputFiles"]["plot.png"] }}'

pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.postgresql
    values:
      url: "jdbc:postgresql://{{ secret('POSTGRES_HOST') }}/data"
      username: "{{ secret('POSTGRES_USERNAME') }}"
      password: "{{ secret('POSTGRES_PASSWORD') }}"
```


We can wrap up this workflow with an App where the user can select his parameters, hit execute and get the graphic he wants.

## Simple Interfaces for Everyday Automation

With Kestra Apps, you can build intuitive, self-service interfaces on top of complex workflows, making automation part of daily operations for teams like product, sales, and customer success.

This capability shines when repetitive, manual processes—like qualifying user research responses or evaluating lead discussions—can be managed by automated workflows.

For example, take a sales or product team managing user inquiries. Traditionally, they might rely on spreadsheets and manual scoring to categorize and respond, leading to delays. By connecting workflows to advanced APIs like Hugging Face, you can automate tasks like categorization and response generation while keeping the interface user-friendly.

Here’s how it works:

- A user provides the context of a discussion or inquiry through the app’s interface.
- The workflow uses an LLM to categorize the inquiry into predefined categories, such as “New Discussion,” “Follow-Up,” or “Discovery.”
- Based on the category, the workflow generates a tailored response aligned with predefined business rules.
- The results are displayed back to the user in an intuitive app interface, with an option to integrate directly into tools like CRMs or databases for further tracking.

Below is an example YAML configuration showcasing how Kestra workflows and Apps make this possible:

```yaml
id: user_research_categorization_feedback
namespace: kestra

inputs:
  - id: user_context
    type: STRING

variables:
  pre_prompt: "You're an senior product manager with a strong baground in user research."
  new_discussion_prompt: "Write a friendly message to welcome the user and ask an open question (what, when, where, etc.) to engage a new discussion"
  follow_up_prompt: "It's been quite a long time you didn't message the user. Write a follow up question to get some news"
  discovery_prompt: "The user already gave you some information about his issues or project timeline. Part of a sales discovery framework set in your sales motion, write a question to deep-dive and get more information about high level use case, project timeline, etc."
