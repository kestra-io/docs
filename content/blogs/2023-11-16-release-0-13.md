We are excited to announce the release of Kestra 0.13.0, featuring two major additions: **multi-tenancy** and a full **Visual Studio Code editor** integrated into the Kestra UI. This new Editor allows you to write and manage custom scripts without having to worry about dependency management and deployments. The multi-tenancy feature helps isolate data and code across different environments, teams, projects, or customers, building upon the existing namespace-level isolation.

**Highlights of this release include:**

ðŸ”¹ An embedded [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) Editor

ðŸ”¹ [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/namespace-files) and the `read()` function, enabling the orchestration of custom scripts and microservices with modular components

ðŸ”¹ Multi-tenancy in the Enterprise Edition, offering enhanced isolation and resource management

ðŸ”¹ A new UI feature for customizing properties of the `Executions` table, improving the tabular view of executions

ðŸ”¹ A revamped UI header with a global search bar for streamlined navigation

ðŸ”¹ The `ForEachItem` task for efficient data processing in micro-batches

ðŸ”¹ A flow-level `concurrency` setting to manage the number of [concurrent executions](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/concurrency) and determine custom behavior upon limit breach

ðŸ”¹ New notification plugins including OpsGenie (Atlassian), Sentry, PagerDuty, Zenduty, Discord, Twilio, WhatsApp, SendGrid, and GoogleChat

ðŸ”¹ A broad array of additional plugins such as Ansible, Terraform, Weaviate, CloudQuery, Excel, Dremio, Arrow Flight, Modal, Dataform, SqlMesh, SQLite, and ClickHouse `BulkInsert`.


**Additional highlights include:**

ðŸ”¹ A new `logLevel` property for all tasks, allowing you to manage the granularity level of logs captured by Kestra's backend

ðŸ”¹ Enhanced webhook filtering via `conditions`

ðŸ”¹ Improved access to `taskrun.value` in `WorkingDirectory` tasks used as child tasks of other [flowable](https://kestra.io/docs/tutorial/flowable) tasks

ðŸ”¹ Support for manual database migration processes and an option to disable automatic migrations, giving you more control over the database migration process in production environments.


Letâ€™s explore these enhancements in detail.

## Introducing the new Kestra Editor

Imagine working on orchestration pipelines would be as effortless as editing local files using your favorite IDE, without having to worry about dependency management, packaging, or deployments. We're excited to introduce **the new Kestra Editor**, which makes that possible by bringing the Visual Studio Code IDE experience right into Kestra.

This feature not only makes your work more efficient but also brings your YAML definitions together with your scripts, microservices, custom queries, and other project files (called [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/namespace-files)) into a single, streamlined interface.

### The problem that the new Editor is aiming to solve

Kestra allows defining complex workflows in a straightforward and declarative manner using a human-readable YAML configuration. With the Kestra UI and the new Editor, a few lines of YAML is all it takes to orchestrate any process or application, eliminating the need to manage development environments or package code. This YAML configuration addresses:

1. **The WHAT**: the tasks that need to be orchestrated.
2. **The HOW**: the order and control flow of tasks, including parallel or sequential execution, process resilience, and the concurrency of flow executions.
3. **The WHEN**: the conditions and timing for the automatic execution of a flow, whether based on a regular schedule, a webhook, or an event trigger.

Kestra's YAML-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) is not only versatile but also intuitive, thanks to its built-in documentation, autocompletion, and syntax validation.

However, **YAML is not intended to replace business logic** expressed in your custom applications, microservices, scripts or queries. We believe in the importance of keeping your business logic and orchestration requirements separate through a well-defined API. This separation ensures that your code remains portable and platform-independent, giving you complete control over your applications, whether it's in Python, SQL, R, Julia, Shell, PowerShell, Node.js, or any other language. With Kestra, there is no need to modify your existing code. Instead, you simply add a layer of YAML configuration on top of your code to orchestrate it.

The new editor is a significant step in bringing together your orchestration and business logic, while still respecting the separation of concerns between them. It allows you to easily view, add, and modify your custom scripts right next to your flow YAML definitions, all within a single, embedded IDE. This embedded IDE has built-in syntax highlighting, code autocompletion, and validation, streamlining the process of managing both orchestration and business logic.

---

### Why Visual Studio Code

Recognized as the most popular IDE [five years in a row](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2023/06/28/so-2023.aspx) in the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/), Visual Studio Code's integration into Kestra offers an intuitive environment for writing complex business logic and orchestrating it efficiently. Our decision to embed VS Code aligns with our commitment to providing a familiar and intuitive toolset to our users.

Every script, query, or configuration file you add to the new embedded VS Code editor is managed in the backend as a [Namespace File](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/namespace-files). You can think of Namespace Files as equivalent of a project in your local IDE or a copy of your Git repository. Namespace Files can hold Python modules, R or Node.js scripts, complex SQL queries, custom scripts, and many more. You can synchronize your Git repository with a specific namespace to orchestrate dbt data transformation jobs, Terraform or Ansible infrastructure, or any other project that contains code and configuration files.

---

### Benefits of the new Namespace Files code editor

Here are some of the most important advantages of the new editor:

- **Simplified deployment patterns**: say goodbye to the time-consuming packaging and deployments. Add your code as Namespace Files and write a few lines of YAML pointing the relevant task to your existing code to orchestrate it with Kestra.
- **More efficient Git workflow**: synchronize your code with Kestra via Git and CI/CD, maintaining Git as the single source of truth for your workflows and application code.
- **Privacy-first**: Kestra ensures your code and data remain private, with Namespace Files persisted in a secure storage interface of your choice. You can leverage your private cloud storage bucket as Kestra's internal storage backend in production. For local development, you can use the local file system on your laptop.
- **Fast feedback loops**: the editor's built-in autocompletion and syntax validation help you write your code faster and free of syntax errors. Execute your flows directly from the editor to get immediate feedback about what works and what doesn't.
- **Stay organized**: by combining namespaces and a nested folder structure in the embedded VS Code editor, you can organize your code and configuration files in a way that makes sense to you and your team.
- **Code reusability**: the new editor makes it easy to re-use code across flows in the same namespace, and [soon](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2337), even across namespaces. When combined with subflows, you get infinite flexibility in orchestrating complex processes with modular components, even in the most demanding enterprise environments.
- **Accessible to all**: the familiar VS Code interface, combined with Kestra's intuitive UI, simplifies onboarding for engineers and business users.
- **Lower barrier to entry**: the new editor reduces the time and expertise needed to orchestrate custom scripts and queries.
- **Improved runtime performance**: with files stored in Kestraâ€™s backend, workflows execute faster, eliminating the need for time-consuming operations like cloning Git repositories or pulling large container images.

## New `ForEachItem` task for scalable data processing

In our ongoing effort to simplify workflow automation and streamline data processing at scale, we're thrilled to introduce a new task called `ForEachItem`. As the name suggests, this task allows you to iterate over a list of items and execute some action for each of them (_or for each batch containing multiple items_).

### Problems that the `ForEachItem` task helps to solve

This feature is particularly useful when you need to process millions of records from a database table or an API payload in a **resilient** and **scalable** way.

A common orchestration use case is to:
1. Fetch a list of records from an external system, e.g. from a third-party API, a database, or a file
2. Execute some action for each item in the list, e.g. send an email, store the item in a production database, or predict a value for that item using a machine learning model.

This use case is fairly easy to manage with a small number of items, but it becomes more challenging at scale. For example, imagine fetching millions of records from some external API with business-critical data such as order information. You need to process each record individually, but you also need to ensure that the process is **reliable**. You can't just retry the entire operation if something fails as it might result in **duplicate** order processing. If only 20 out of 1 million records fail, you need to be able to troubleshoot and fix the issue without having to reprocess the entire list. This is where the `ForEachItem` task comes in handy. It allows you to process each item individually, while also providing the ability to **troubleshoot** and **restart data processing for individual items that failed**.

This task can also help to improve the **scalability** of your data pipelines. You can split large files that don't fit in memory into micro-batches and process them in parallel across multiple workers or containers.

![foreachitem](/blogs/2023-11-16-release-0-13/foreachitem.png)

---

### How does it work

The `ForEachItem` task takes a list of items as input, and executes a subflow for each item in the list. The subflow can be executed in parallel or sequentially, depending on the subflow's `concurrency` setting.

Here's the syntax for implementing the `ForEachItem` task:

```yaml
  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ inputs.file }}" # could be also an output variable e.g. {{ outputs.extract.uri }}
    batch:
      rows: 100 # split the file into batches of 100 items/rows/lines per batch
      partitions: 10 # split the file into 10 batches
      bytes: "1024MB" # split the file into batches of 1024MB
    namespace: your_subflow_namespace
    flowId: your_subflow_id
    inputs:
      your_input_name: "{{ taskrun.items }}" # items of the batch passed to the subflow's inputs
    revision: 1 # optional subflow's revision (default: latest)
    wait: true # wait for all subflow executions to complete before continuing
    transmitFailed: true # fail the task run if any subflow execution fails
    labels: # optional labels to pass to the subflow executions
      key: value
```

Using this configuration, the task will split the file into batches based on your chosen strategy (either `rows`, `partitions`, or `bytes`). It will then execute the subflow for each batch, passing the batch of items to the subflow's inputs. The subflow can then process each item (or batch) individually, and you can troubleshoot and restart individual items if something fails.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that the batch of items is passed to the subflow using `inputs`. In the example above, we use an input of `FILE` type named `your_input_name`, which accepts the URI of an internal storage file containing the batch of items. This way, you can trigger the subflow independently which is especially useful for testing and debugging purposes. Imagine how you can test that subflow first with a small file. Once you are confident that it works as expected, the `ForEachItem` task will help scale the process to millions of items.

### Full end-to-end example

Here is a full end-to-end example of how to use the `ForEachItem` task to process a list of items. The example uses a subflow with two tasks to show how you can read both, the file's path and the file's content.

Here is the subflow that will be invoked for each item in the list:

```yaml
id: orders
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: order
    type: STRING

tasks:
  - id: read_file
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - cat "{{ inputs.order }}"

  - id: read_file_content
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.log.Log
    message: "{{ read(inputs.order) }}"
```

Here is the parent flow that uses the `ForEachItem` task to iterate over a list of items and run the above `subflow` for each item (i.e. for each batch split into `rows: 1` per iteration):

```yaml
id: orders_parallel
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    sql: |
      INSTALL httpfs;
      LOAD httpfs;
      SELECT *
      FROM read_csv_auto('https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv', header=True);
    store: true

  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.ForEachItem
    items: "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"
    batch:
      rows: 1
    namespace: company.team
    flowId: orders
    wait: true
    transmitFailed: true
    inputs:
      order: "{{ taskrun.items }}"
```

::alert{type="info"}
Whether you're dealing with large datasets or need to process items individually, `ForEachItem` offers a simple and resilient way to automate data processing at scale

For detailed information on how to use that task, refer to the [ForEachItem task documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/tasks#foreachitem).

## Introducing flow-level concurrency control

At the core of any robust workflow management system is the ability to reliably manage execution and their underlying resources. In line with this, we're introducing the flow-level `concurrency` setting. This flow-level property allows you to control the number of concurrent executions of a specific flow. By setting the `limit` key, you can define the maximum number of executions that can run simultaneously. This acts as a global concurrency limit for the particular flow, ensuring that the defined limit is respected across all executions, regardless of their initiation method â€” be it a regular schedule, event trigger, webhook, API call, or an ad-hoc run from the UI.

---

### Problems solved by the flow-level concurrency setting

One of the primary challenges in workflow management is distributing work to ensure **optimal resource utilization**. For example, if your flow performs a resource-intensive operation, you may want to ensure that only a limited number of executions are running at any given time to avoid overloading the system. Often you also need to ensure that only a specific number of processes interact with a given database or API to limit the number of open database connections and avoid API request throttling. The concurrency limit allows you to queue additional executions above the allowed threshold to reduce the backpressure on the external system your flow is interacting with.

Similarly, when dealing with business-critical processes that can't be duplicated, such as sending a notification or processing a payment, you need to ensure that there is at most only one running execution. This is also where the flow-level concurrency limit comes in handy. By setting the concurrency `limit` to 1, you can **ensure that only one execution of the flow is running at any given time**. Any additional execution attempts will be queued or cancelled, according to the `behavior` you define.

---

### Customizable behavior upon exceeding the concurrency limit

The `concurrency` property isn't just about limiting concurrent executions; it's also about how the system responds when this limit is reached. The `behavior` property allows you to automatically control the execution state when the defined limit is exceeded. This property is an Enum-type setting with three options: `QUEUE`, `CANCEL`, or `FAIL`.

- `QUEUE`: Additional executions are queued until a running execution completes.
- `CANCEL`: Additional executions are immediately canceled.
- `FAIL`: Additional executions are marked as failed.

This customization ensures that the system's response aligns with your operational requirements.

---

### Usage example

To illustrate how you can use the `concurrency` property, consider a simple flow that limits its concurrent executions to 1:

```yaml
id: concurrency_limited_flow
namespace: company.team

concurrency:
  behavior: QUEUE
  limit: 1 # can be any integer >= 1

tasks:
  - id: bash
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - sleep 10
```

When multiple executions are triggered, the concurrency property ensures they adhere to the defined limit and behavior. In this example, there will be only one execution of the flow running at any given time and all additional executions will be queued until the running execution completes.

::alert{type="info"}
The introduction of flow-level concurrency settings enables better resource management, reduces the risk of system overload, and ensures idempotency of critical processes.

## New `logLevel` task property for better log management

The new `logLevel` task property, available on all tasks, allows you to control log granularity to be captured by Kestra's backend to save log storage space. This is particularly useful to avoid `DEBUG` or `TRACE`-level logs to be stored in production environments, while allowing you to keep them in development environments.

The `logLevel` property, with its **default** setting to **store all logs**, can be adjusted to levels like `INFO`, ensuring that more detailed logs below this threshold, such as `DEBUG` and `TRACE`, are not persisted. This approach gives you more control about which logs should be stored and helps to reduce storage costs.

---

## UI enhancements

### The UI header gets a new look

The UI header has been revamped to include a global search bar and a new navigation menu. Soon, the search bar will allow you to search for flows, tasks, and namespaces. For now, it serves as an omnipresent navigation tool, allowing you to quickly access the main UI pages from anywhere in the UI.

![header](/blogs/2023-11-16-release-0-13/header.png)

---

### New UI feature for customizing Execution columns

By default, the Executions table displays the execution ID, execution's start and end date, the runtime duration, namespace, flow ID, execution labels and status, and the trigger that launched the execution.

The UI now allows you to fully **customize** this view by adding or removing columns, including **new dedicated properties** for inputs, flow's revision used in that execution, the final task of the flow, and more.

![columns](/blogs/2023-11-16-release-0-13/columns.png)

---

## Introducing multi-tenancy in the Enterprise Edition

This release introduces multi-tenancy in Kestra's Enterprise Edition. This feature allows a single Kestra instance to support multiple tenants independently. For developers and platform administrators, this offers better resource isolation and management. End-users benefit from a more streamlined experience across various environments.

![multitenancy](/blogs/2023-11-16-release-0-13/multitenancy.png)

---

### Why tenants

1. **Environment management**: multi-tenancy allows for managing development, staging, and production environments within a single Kestra instance. This reduces the overhead of maintaining multiple instances, and makes it easy to switch between environments.
2. **Data isolation**: teams, business units, or even different customers can operate in fully isolated environments while sharing the same Kestra instance along with the same Single Sign-On (SSO) provider. This separation ensures data privacy and security, a critical aspect for enterprise applications.
3. **Resource isolation**: once you enable multi-tenancy, resources such as flows, triggers, executions, and RBAC are separated by tenant. This way, the same identifiers and namespaces can exist simultaneously in different tenants without interfering with each other. For example, two different tenants can have a `prod` namespace, fully isolated from each other.
4. **Simple configuration**: multi-tenancy is not enabled by default to maintain backward compatibility. However, setting it up and creating tenants is straightforward. More information is available in the [Administrator Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/architecture#multi-tenancy).
5. **Intuitive UI navigation**: the UI includes a tenant selection dropdown, allowing you to seamlessly switch between tenants. To ensure clear navigation, the tenant identifier is included in the URL at all times.

---

### Tenant creation and management

Tenants can be managed in several ways. You can create and manage tenants via UI, using a CLI command, an API call, or using Kestra's Terraform provider.

A critical note for administrators: users who create a tenant are automatically assigned administrative rights for that tenant.

::alert{type="warning"}
**A note to plugin authors**: due to the multi-tenancy feature, some Java APIs of Kestra have changed, so you may need to adapt your plugin. Noticeable changes are the `StorageInterface` on which each method now takes a `tenantId` as a parameter (_you can use the `null` tenant in tests_) and the `RunnerUtils` that takes a `tenantId` to run a flow (_also here, you can use `null` in tests_). Check [the following URL](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-notifications/commit/d8935b54395c6a213d8e844f004b3f3698281637#diff-0a44b7ad6627bafd72[â€¦]435228407fc6edb6dcb93d91) for an example of what is needed to retrieve the `tenantId` in the notifications plugin. If you struggle to make your custom plugin compatible with the new multi-tenancy feature, don't hesitate to reach out to us via [Slack](https://kestra.io/slack), e.g. in a `#contributors` channel.
::

---

### Backward compatibility and the default tenant

In existing Kestra instances, the default tenant (referred to as the null tenant) maintains backward compatibility when multi-tenancy is activated. For new Kestra instances, we recommend disabling the default tenant. This practice ensures that all tenants are clearly defined with their unique identifiers.

The addition of multi-tenancy in Kestra represents a major milestone in addressing complex enterprise-grade orchestration requirements with support for resource and data isolation across environments, teams, projects, and customers.

---

## Important notes when upgrading to Kestra 0.13.0

Due to multi-tenancy, all indexes will be rebuilt. When using the JDBC runner with a large database, database migration can take multiple hours. We recommend performing the migration manually before starting Kestra itself by using the new `kestra sys database migrate` command.

Additionally, all identifiers (i.e. the ID for tenants, namespaces, flows, triggers, inputs, variables, tasks and secrets) must start with an alphanumeric character. Existing flows that contain invalid identifier (e.g. a flow starting with `_`) will still be executable but no longer modifiable.

---

## New plugins (21 of them!)

Kestra 0.13 brings a wide range of new notification plugins to send alerts and notifications to your team when a flow completes or fails.

We've also added plugins for a variety of other services and open-source tools.

To avoid overwhelming you with details, we'll only list the new plugins in alphabetical order. For more information on how to use them, refer to the respective [Plugin Documentation](https://kestra.io/plugins) and [Blueprints](https://demo.kestra.io/ui/blueprints/community).
