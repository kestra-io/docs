## Elevating Your Data Workflow With Kestra's Terraform Provider ##

Our Terraform provider is a significant step in aligning data orchestration with infrastructure-as-code best practices. With this integration, configuring Kestra workflows and tasks directly within your Terraform scripts is a seamless experience. It's an integrated approach to streamline and automate all your flows.

### Supercharge Your CI/CD with Terraform & Kestra ###
Bring Kestra into your CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions. By doing so you can automate your infrastructure provisioning but also deploy your Kestra flows in the CI/CD model. With a GitHub Actions workflow, you can also validate and deploy flows directly into different namespaces ensuring that your data workflows are as agile and adaptable as your infrastructure.

### Unlocking Data Efficiency: 5 Million Executions and 4,000+ Flows with Kestra and Terraform ###
**Leroy Merlin France** achieved new heights in data agility by integrating Kestra and Terraform, both employing declarative language and fully embracing Git-based version control. They used Terraform for automated deployments of BigQuery assets like datasets, tables, views, and ACLs, all part of a streamlined CI/CD process. Upon adopting Kestra, a custom Terraform provider was developed to bring the same level of version control and automation to Kestra’s resources. This harmonized architecture has led to over **5 million pipeline executions** each month, and more than **4.000+ data flows created**, and a staggering 900% increase in data activity, all while fostering team-wide confidence during production deployments.
