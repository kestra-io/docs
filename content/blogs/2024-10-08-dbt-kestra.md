When using dbt, you often need tools that can handle large, complex workflows and automate tasks across different environments. At Kestra, we’ve built a suite of features to manage dbt projects in the best way possible, from syncing code with Git, scaling your dbt workflows on-demand with [Task Runners](https://kestra.io/docs/task-runners) to flexible code management using [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/namespace-files). Here’s how Kestra can simplify your dbt workflows and make data transformation more scalable.

### Sync dbt Projects from Git and Edit Directly in Kestra

With Kestra, you can sync your dbt projects directly from Git repositories, giving you instant access to view and edit code without leaving the Kestra platform. This setup keeps your dbt codebase updated in real-time and lets you manage files across different environments. Here’s how you can configure a flow that clones a dbt project from Git and uploads it to your Kestra namespace:

```yaml
id: upload_dbt_project
namespace: company.datateam.dbt
description: |

  allowing you to develop directly in the Kestra UI.
tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: git_clone
        type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/dbt-example
        branch: master

      - id: upload
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.namespace.UploadFiles
        files:
          - "glob:**/dbt/**"
```

With this flow, you can quickly sync code changes from Git, modify them directly in the Kestra UI, and then use `PushNamespaceFiles` to update your repository. This makes it easy to work on dbt code in real time, similar to what you’d get with dbt Cloud—right from the Kestra OSS platform.

## Scale dbt Projects with Kestra’s Task Runners

For teams managing large, complex data workflows, Kestra provides task runners that allow you to allocate resources to your dbt runs dynamically. This way, you can optimize performance without over-provisioning, all while ensuring your workflows are as responsive and efficient as possible.

Here’s a quick example of how to set up task runners in Kestra to manage dbt workflows with isolated execution environments:

```yaml
id: dbt_build
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: sync
    type: io.kestra.plugin.git.SyncNamespaceFiles
    disabled: true
    url: https://github.com/kestra-io/dbt-example
    branch: master
    namespace: company.team
    gitDirectory: dbt
    dryRun: false

  - id: dbt_build
    type: io.kestra.plugin.dbt.cli.DbtCLI
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/dbt-duckdb:latest
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.Docker
    commands:
      - dbt build
```

## Scale Compute for dbt with Task Runners 

In the example above:

- The `sync` task retrieves the latest version of a dbt project from Git, making it accessible within your Kestra namespace. Since `disabled` is set to `true`, this step is only run if enabled.
- The `dbt_build` task then launches a `dbt build` command in a Docker container, which provides an isolated, consistent environment for running dbt. This approach ensures your build processes remain portable and repeatable.

## Use Docker for Isolation

By default, Docker is used here as the task runner, meaning each `dbt build` task runs in a controlled, containerized environment. This setup is ideal for standard dbt workloads, providing the necessary dependencies without affecting your underlying infrastructure.

## Scale with Kubernetes for Compute-Intensive Workloads

For larger workloads, such as dbt projects with hundreds of models or more complex data transformations, you can switch to Kubernetes for on-demand resource scaling:

```yaml
  - id: dbt_build
    type: io.kestra.plugin.dbt.cli.DbtCLI
    containerImage: ghcr.io/kestra-io/dbt-duckdb:latest
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.kubernetes.runner.Kubernetes
    commands:
      - dbt build
```

This configuration allows you to allocate CPU and memory resources dynamically, reducing runtime by scaling up infrastructure only when needed. By running on Kubernetes, you ensure your dbt workflows have access to the necessary compute power, even for the most resource-intensive tasks. As your dbt project scales, Kubernetes can grow with it, providing an efficient way to handle peak loads without requiring a permanent increase in infrastructure.

## Manage your dbt code with Namespace Files

With the `UploadFiles`, `DownloadFiles`, and `DeleteFiles` tasks, Kestra lets you manage namespace files more flexibly. For example, `DownloadFiles` allows you to pull namespace files from one project into another, making it easy to share code across projects and teams.

Here’s how you can set up namespace file management:

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.namespace.DownloadFiles
    sourceNamespace: "company.team.other"
    files:
      - "glob:**/dbt/**"

  - id: delete
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.namespace.DeleteFiles
    files:
      - "glob:**/dbt/temp/**"
```

This flexibility allows you to easily share code, manage updates, and ensure that development environments stay synchronized with production. For example, use the `UploadFiles` task to automatically upload the latest version of your dbt code to your Kestra instance, and use `DeleteFiles` to keep everything organized and up-to-date.

## Manage dbt Execution Logs in Large-Scale dbt Projects

Managing a dbt project with hundreds of models means handling a significant amount of log data. Kestra provides enhanced logging options that make it easy to filter by log level and navigate the information you need. This feature is especially helpful for pinpointing issues in large projects, allowing you to identify and address errors more quickly.

With Kestra’s logging, you can drill down into logs in real-time and avoid digging through unnecessary information, helping you maintain visibility into your dbt workflows even as they grow in complexity.

## Conclusion

With Kestra, you get a complete platform for orchestrating and scaling dbt workflows. From syncing code with Git and scaling runs dynamically to event-driven triggers and reliable code versioning, Kestra provides the tools you need to handle even the most complex dbt projects.

Whether you’re a data engineer looking for more control over resource allocation or an analytics engineer wanting a straightforward way to edit dbt code with Git integration, Kestra has you covered. Check out our [dbt plugin documentation](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-dbt) for more details.
