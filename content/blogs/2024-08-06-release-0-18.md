</div>


Let's dive in to see how those enhancements can benefit your workflows!

---

## KV Store 🔑

Kestra's workflows are **stateless**. By default, all executions are isolated from each other to avoid any unintended side effects. When you pass data between tasks, you do so explicitly by passing outputs from one task to another and that data is persisted in Kestra's internal storage. This stateless execution model ensures that workflows are **idempotent** and can be **executed anywhere** in parallel, at any scale.

However, in certain scenarios, your workflow might need to share data beyond passing outputs from one task to another. For example, you might want to persist data across executions or even across different workflows. This is where the [new KV Store](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3609) comes in!

This release introduces `KV Store` to bring statefulness to your workflows. KV Store allows you to **persist any data produced in your workflows in a convenient key-value format**, eliminating the need to manage an external database or storage system to persist such data.

You can create new KV pairs directly from the Kestra UI, via dedicated tasks in your flow, via Terraform or via our REST API. Then, you can read any stored `value` by its `key` in any task or trigger with a simple `{{ kv('YOUR_KEY') }}` expression, making it easy to share data across flows and executions.

Since the `KV Store` has been built on top of Kestra's internal storage (which can be any cloud storage service like `S3` or `GCS`):
1. There are **no limits** with respect to the amount of data you can persist for each key — if you need to persist a 1 TB large CSV file to pass it between workflows, no problem! To help you avoid cluttering your storage space with large objects, you can set a custom Time-to-Live (TTL) for any key and Kestra will take care of cleaning up the data for the expired keys.
2. You keep **full control and privacy** over any data stored in Kestra's KV Store as it's persisted within your private Cloud storage bucket.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNv_z-tnwnQ?si=nJYa-AR6Fa_ylTGR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Note that KV Store is a Namespace-level feature — to start adding new KV pairs, navigate to any given `Namespace` and then click on the `KV Store` tab.

::alert{type="info"}
If you are on Enterprise Edition, make sure to add a `KVSTORE` permission to any `Role` that needs access to the KV Store. You need to explicitly add that permission to see the `KV Store` tab in the UI. You can fully customize which Roles can `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` KV pairs, and you can restrict those permissions to a specific namespace when needed.
::

Overall, the KV store is a powerful addition to Kestra's orchestration capabilities allowing you to persist state and share data across flows and executions.

Read more about the KV Store in our [Concepts documentation](/docs/concepts/kv-store).

## New Namespaces Overview 📊

Before Kestra 0.18.0, the `Namespaces` UI page suffered from the following issues:
1. That page only displayed **existing namespaces** — those explicitly created from the UI or via Terraform. Other namespaces used in flows were displayed in a greyed-out state, which led to confusion among many users.
2. The **hierarchy** of nested namespaces was missing, which made it difficult to understand the parent-child relationships between namespaces.

![namespaces_before_0_18](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/namespaces_before_0_18.png)

The `Namespaces` page has been [fully redesigned](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3609) in Kestra 0.18.0 to address these issues. You will now see all namespaces used in any flow in a hierarchical structure, including nested child namespaces that can be expanded and collapsed. And we're excited to announce that this feature is now available in the Open Source version as well!

We have also added the `Editor` tab to the `Namespace` page, offering one more place from where you can access and manage [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/namespace-files).

Here is how the new `Namespaces` overview page looks like in Kestra 0.18.0 (in both Open Source and Enterprise Edition):

![namespaces_after_0_18](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/namespaces_after_0_18.png)

Here is a detailed page for a Namespace in the Open-Source version — note how the `KV Store` is displayed as one of the Namespace-level tabs:

![namespace_oss](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/namespace_oss.png)

And here is how the same Namespace page looks like in the Enterprise Edition:

![namespace_ee](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/namespace_ee.png)

Check the following video demo for a deep dive into the new `Namespaces` UI:

</div>

## SCIM Directory Sync 🗂️

The Enterprise Edition of Kestra now supports Directory Sync Integration via SCIM 2.0 protocol, allowing you to keep your users and groups in sync between your Identity Provider (IdP) and Kestra.

Our SCIM integration allows you to automate provisioning and de-provisioning of users and groups. Instead of manually creating and managing users in Kestra, you can sync them from your IdP via our SCIM API endpoint.

![scim](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/scim.jpeg)

At the time of this release, we have tested and [documented](/docs/enterprise/scim) our SCIM integration with Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak, and authentik. If you are using a different IdP or struggle to set up SCIM with Kestra, please [reach out](/demo/).

---

## SQL Server Backend (Preview) 🛠️

Based on requests from several Enterprise customers, we've added SQL Server as a backend database option for Kestra EE. This feature is currently in preview, and we are looking for feedback from early adopters of this backend.

Until we remove the `preview` label, we recommend using SQL Server in a development/staging environments only, and PostgreSQL for production JDBC-based deployments.

To help you set up a SQL Server backend, check our [Database Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration-guide/database).

---

## Audit Logs Overhaul 🕵️

Our audit logs have undergone a comprehensive refactor in this release, making it easier to track changes.

![audit_logs](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/audit_logs.jpg)

You can now filter Audit Log events created by a specific `User`. Each audit log now additionally includes the information whether a given resource has been `Created`, `Updated` or `Deleted`. And when you need to dive even deeper, click on the `Changes` icon to see a JSON diff of the changes displayed in a Git-like diff format, similar to the one you can see in the flow revision history.

![audit_logs_diff](/docs/enterprise/audit_logs/audit_logs_diff.gif)

We've also introduced a couple of new log events, e.g. for Tenant-level changes like Tenant created, renamed or deleted.

---

## Secrets Enhancements 🔐

This release has brought additional improvements to our **Secrets** handling, allowing for description and tagging of secrets, and more cost-effective API calls to external secrets managers.

Instead of querying all available secrets in a fast (but potentially costly) manner, Kestra now lists secrets more gradually, starting by querying the flow's namespace (without including parent namespaces). If the requested secret was not found, we search for it one level higher in the namespace hierarchy, and then another level higher, and so on.

To further limit the number of required API calls to the Secrets Manager, we've introduced a new `cache` property under the `kestra.secret` configuration section. When enabled, Kestra will cache the secrets, reducing the number of API calls to the secrets manager.

```yaml
kestra:
  secret:
    type: aws-secret-manager
    cache:
      enabled: true # false by default
      maximumSize: 1000
      expireAfterWrite: 60s
    aws-secret-manager:
      accessKeyId: mysuperaccesskey
      secretKeyId: mysupersecretkey
      region: us-east-1
```

The `cache` section includes the following properties:
- `kestra.secret.cache.enabled`: whether to enable caching for secrets
- `kestra.secret.cache.maximumSize`: the maximum number of cached entries
- `kestra.secret.cache.expireAfterWrite`: a duration after which the cache will be invalidated.


Apart from the more **cost-effective handling of API calls** to secrets managers, you can now forward kestra-specific `tags` and a `description` of the secret to the secrets manager.

![secrets_enhancements](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/secrets_enhancements.png)

Finally, you can add a global configuration to automatically forward some `tags` to all newly created or updated secrets managed by Kestra:

```yaml
kestra:
  secret:
    type: aws-secret-manager
    tags:
      application: kestra
      environment: production
```

---

## New Outputs UI 📤

Based on [your feedback](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/1528), we're excited to introduce the new Outputs UI!

The Outputs tab now displays Execution outputs in a **multi-column format** with a hierarchical structure, allowing you to **gradually expand nested outputs**.

![outputs](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/outputs.png)

All existing features such as the **Outputs preview** and the ability to **render custom expressions** are still available — the only change here is that the `Render Expressions` field has been renamed to `Debug Outputs`.

---

## Realtime Triggers Enhancements ⚡️

To make Realtime Triggers more observable and easier to troubleshoot, we've extended the trigger view with logs and a restart functionality. For each Realtime Trigger, you can now dive into its logs and restart it directly from the UI when needed.

![realtime_trigger_ui](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/realtime_trigger_ui.png)

If a `RealtimeTrigger` is misconfigured (e.g. invalid SQS or Kafka credentials), Kestra will now immediately generate a failed Execution with a friendly error message asking you to verify the trigger configuration. You can then correct the misconfigured properties and restart the trigger from the UI.

---

## Other UI Enhancements 🎨

### New Default and Temporal logs display

The UI now provides a new view to display workflow execution **logs**. In addition to the Default view showing logs grouped by a task, you can now switch to a Temporal view showing both task logs and flow logs in a raw timestamp-ordered format. This allows you to see:
1. The exact order of logs as they were emitted during the execution
2. [Additional logs](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2521) not related to any specific task emitted by the Executor e.g. logs related to concurrency limits, errors in flowable or executable tasks, etc.

![temporal_default_logs](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/temporal_default_logs.png)

The GIF below shows how you can switch between both views:

![temporal_default_logs](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/temporal.gif)

### Quality of Life Improvements

All subflow executions (those created via a `Subflow` task and those created via `ForEachItem`) now [generate](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2481#issuecomment-2233326952) clickable links to the corresponding subflow and its execution, simplifying the navigation in parent-child workflows:

![subflow_links](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/subflow_links.png)

The `Execute` modal now [additionally displays](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3585) a `Copy as cURL` button making it easier to trigger your execution from anywhere:

![execute_curl](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/execute_curl.png)

## General Availability of Task Runners 🏃

One of the major highlights of Kestra 0.18.0 is that **Task Runners** are now **out of Beta**!

Task Runners is a pluggable system capable of executing your tasks in remote environments. We introduced task runners in Beta in Kestra 0.16.0, and since then, we've been improving their performance, stability, and usability. Thanks to the feedback from over 80 users and many enhancements and bug fixes, Task Runners are now generally available and ready for production use at scale.

Check the video below for a Task Runners feature showcase:

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edYa8WAMAdQ?si=WiXpLNPOwk3mekwh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Below are the main enhancements to Task Runners added in this release:
- The `taskRunner` property has been added to all CLI tasks including `DbtCLI`, `TerraformCLI`, and all other script tasks.
- The `runner` property has been deprecated in favor of the now generally available `taskRunner` property, which provides more flexibility and allows you to run your code in different remote environments, including Kubernetes, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, Google Batch, and more.
- The Docker Task Runner now [uses a volume](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3857) instead of a bind-mount, resolving permission issues with a root user.
- Files added to the `WorkingDirectory` task are [now correctly injected](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4279) into the `taskRunner` container's working directory.
- dbt outputs are [now captured](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-dbt/issues/113) across all task runners (though keep in mind that you may need to add `projectDir` and add the `--project-dir dbt/` to your dbt command).
- Killing an Execution will now also stop the remote container created by the Task Runner, ensuring that no compute resources are running unnecessarily.
- We [no longer create a new job](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws/issues/402) when resubmitting a task with the `AWS`/`Azure`/`Google` Batch task runners. Instead, we now reuse the existing job.
- We [improved](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws/issues/415) processing of `outputFiles` so that you can now declare which files should be captured as outputs using a simple RegEx expression e.g. `"*.json"`.
- Kubernetes task runner [now also supports](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-kubernetes/issues/136) [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) via a dedicated `serviceAccountName` field.


::alert{type="info"}
Note that starting from Kestra 0.18.0, the Docker and Process task runners are included in the Open Source edition. The Kubernetes, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, Google Batch, and Google Cloud Run task runners require an [Enterprise Edition](../docs/06.enterprise/index.md) license or a [Kestra Cloud account](/cloud/). If you are interested in trying them out, please [reach out](/demo/).
::

Task Runners in Kestra 0.18.0 offer a more resilient file handling and more stability when recovering from failure in remote compute environments. Read more about Task Runners in our [Concepts Documentation](../docs/05.concepts/09.task-runners/index.md).

---

## Enhancements to the Core Tasks 🛠️

### New `ForEach` task

A new `ForEach` core task has been [introduced](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2137) to unify and simplify parallel and sequential task executions, replacing (_in a non-breaking way!_) the `EachParallel` and `EachSequential` tasks. Those old tasks are deprecated but you can still use them — take as much time as you need to migrate.

Check the [plugin documentation](/plugins/core/tasks/flow/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.foreach) for the new `ForEach` task to learn more.

### New `SELECT` and `MULTISELECT` input types

The new `SELECT` and `MULTISELECT` input types provide a more intuitive and improved functionality over the (now deprecated) `ENUM`-type input. They both allow you to provide a list of values to choose from, with `SELECT` allowing only [one value](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4024) to be selected and `MULTISELECT` allowing [multiple values](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4063) to be selected.

### Improved JSON and ION Handling

We've made [several improvements](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3715) to JSON and ION handling. To avoid confusion between the `json` filter and `json()` function, we've renamed:
1. the `json` filter to `toJson` — it converts an object into a JSON string e.g. `{{ [1, 2, 3] | toJson  }}`
2. the `json()` function to `fromJson` — it converts a JSON string into an object so you can access JSON properties using the dot notation e.g. `{{ fromJson(kv('JSON_KEY')).property }}`.

We've also implemented equivalent functionality for ION — the new `fromIon()` function converts an ION string into a data structure or object. This function will raise an error if you try to parse a multi-line string (i.e. an ION file with multiple rows) for performance reasons.

::alert{type="info"}
The renaming has been implemented in a non-breaking way — using `json()` will raise a warning in the UI but it will still work.
::

### Support for Unix Cron Expressions

We have added support for standard Unix cron expressions with the additional second-level field in the `cron` expression, allowing for more precise scheduling in your workflows.

Note that this is a non-breaking change. You need to explicitly add the `withSeconds: true` property to your `Schedule` trigger to enable the sixth field in your cron expressions. If you don't add this property, the `cron` expression will be parsed using 5 fields (at a minute level) as before.

The example below shows how to schedule a flow to run every 5 seconds:

```yaml
id: every_5_seconds
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: log
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: This workflow runs every 5 seconds!

triggers:
  - id: every_5_seconds
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    withSeconds: true
    cron: "*/5 * * * * *"
```

### Human-readable schedules

Speaking of scheduling, the UI now displays CRON schedules in a human-readable format, making it easier to understand when your executions are scheduled to run.

For example, instead of `0 9 * * *`, the `Flows` page will now display the trigger as `At 09:00 AM`.

![humanized_cron](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/humanized_cron.png)

Big thanks to [Yuri](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4211) for contributing this powerful enhancement!

### Improved `null` Handling

We've resolved an issue with the null coalescing operator to ensure it functions correctly when processing both empty (null) and undefined inputs.

Learn more in a dedicated [How-to Guide](/docs/how-to-guides/null-values).

### Deleting executions now also deletes their logs and metrics

When you delete an execution from the UI, you [now have the option](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3987) to choose whether you also want to delete the logs, metrics and internal storage files related to that execution. Starting from Kestra 0.18.0, we now purge all execution-related data by default. This ensures that your storage space is not cluttered with logs, metrics or files for executions that no longer exist. However, you have full flexibility to choose whether you want to keep that data for specific executions.

![delete_execution](/blogs/2024-08-06-release-0-18/delete_execution.png)

### New Tasks to Manage Namespace Files

We've added new tasks `UploadFiles`, `DownloadFiles`, and `DeleteFiles` allowing you to automatically manage your namespace files from a flow. Those tasks are primarily intended to help you manage and share code between projects and teams.

The `DownloadFiles` task allows you to download Namespace Files stored in another namespace to facilitate sharing code across projects and teams.

The `UploadFiles` and `DeleteFiles` are useful to help you manage code changes, e.g. when you want to upload the latest changes of your production dbt project to your Kestra instance and develop your dbt code further from the Kestra UI. The example below shows how to do that.

```yaml
id: upload_dbt_project
namespace: company.datateam.dbt
description: |
  This flow will download the latest dbt project from a Git repository
  and upload it to the Kestra instance.
  It's useful when developing your dbt code directly from the Kestra Editor.
  Later, you can use the PushNamespaceFiles task to push the changes back to Git.
tasks:
  - id: wdir
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: git_clone
        type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/dbt-example
        branch: master

      - id: upload
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.namespace.UploadFiles
        files:
          - "glob:**/dbt/**"
```

## New Improved Purge Process 🧹

As your workflows grow, you may need to clean up old executions and logs to avoid running out of disk space.

We've [improved](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/4298) the mechanism of the **Purge tasks** to make them more performant and reliable:
- `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge` has been renamed to `io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions` to reflect that it only purges data related to executions (_e.g. not including trigger logs — to purge those you should use the `PurgeLogs` task_) — we've added an alias so that using the old task type will still work but it will emit a warning. We recommend using the new task type.
- `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeExecution` has been renamed to `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.PurgeCurrentExecutionFiles` to reflect that it can purge all execution-related data incl. inputs to an Execution and Execution outputs — also here, we've added an alias so that using the old task type will still work but it will emit a warning. Again, we recommend adjusting your flow code to match the new task type.

From Kestra 0.18.0 on, the recommended way to clean execution and logs is using a combination of `io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions` and the newly added `io.kestra.plugin.core.log.PurgeLogs` task that removes all logs (both Execution logs and Trigger logs) in a performant batch operation. Combining those two together will give you the same functionality as the previous `io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Purge` task but in a more performant and reliable way (roughly [10x faster](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/4298#issuecomment-2220106142)).

```yaml
id: purge
namespace: company.myteam
description: |
  This flow will remove all executions older than one month and all logs older than one month.
  We recommend running this flow daily to avoid running out of disk space and keep the purging operation efficient.

tasks:
  - id: purge_executions
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"
    purgeLog: false

  - id: purge_logs
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.PurgeLogs
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"

triggers:
  - id: daily
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "@daily"
```
