title: "Bringing DevOps Best Practices to All Workflows"
description: "DevOps has transformed software development over the past 15 years, establishing a high standard for efficiency, collaboration, and standardization. However, in the data and operational domains**, we still see fragmentation where unified workflows should be. Here, processes often rely on isolated tools that create silos, preventing the collaboration that modern workflows demand."

Despite growing demands for **orchestration, CI/CD, and end-to-end monitoring** across all operational and data workflows, many teams still depend on scattered tools that manage only parts of the process. This tool-driven approach reduces productivity, complicates maintenance, and delays troubleshooting.

The alternative? A **unified platform** that integrates workflows, supports **open standards**, and scales flexibly — applying DevOps best practices not just to software, but across all **Ops** disciplines.

## Embracing an Ops-Everything Model

While many data platforms market DataOps as the ultimate solution, implementing DataOps alone often creates yet another layer of complexity. Instead of managing workflows in isolation or simply mirroring DevOps, the solution lies in an **Ops-Everything** approach — where all operational workflows are centralized and integrated.

Data workflows are often spread across **ETL/ELT platforms, machine learning tools, data warehouses**, and various language-dependent scheduling systems, each creating silos that lead to key issues:

- **Fragmented Processes**: Isolated tools and processes create inconsistent standards and monitoring, which hinders collaboration and operational efficiency.
- **Limited Observability**: Disparate tools make it difficult to gain a clear view of workflows from end to end, leading to time-consuming monitoring and incomplete root-cause analysis.
- **Scaling Constraints**: Tools suited for smaller workloads often require custom integrations as needs grow, introducing additional complexity and technical debt.

What’s needed is an **OPS-everything model** — a unified orchestration layer that provides centralized visibility and integrates with existing tools, allowing organizations to scale without added silos.

## Unified Orchestration Across Workflows

To achieve scalable, resilient workflows, teams need an orchestration platform that supports automation across data and operational workflows with the same rigor as DevOps. Effective orchestration centralizes integration, visibility, and consistency across lifecycle stages. Here’s what an ideal solution should include:

1. **Comprehensive Orchestration for All Workflows**Unified orchestration ensures that all parts of the data journey — from ingestion to deployment — operate in sync, without tool-specific constraints that limit flexibility.
2. **Centralized Monitoring and Observability**A single control plane that offers complete visibility, real-time alerts, and audit trails allows faster issue resolution.
3. **Standards-Based CI/CD**Consistent, automated testing and deployment ensure workflows are reliable, predictable, and aligned with DevOps principles, improving overall collaboration and efficiency.
4. **Modular, Vendor-Neutral Design**A flexible, modular platform prevents vendor lock-in, enabling organizations to adapt and scale with their evolving needs, supporting integration with various tools.
5. **Declarative, Reproducible Workflows**Code-based, version-controlled workflows make processes reproducible and scalable, reducing manual intervention and ensuring that workflows are consistent across teams and projects.

## Bringing DevOps Best Practices to All Workflows

Establishing an effective **Ops-Everything** framework requires a comprehensive platform that integrates best practices, adaptability, and transparency across all operations. To build a mature Ops strategy, organizations should:

- **Adopt a Centralized Control Plane**: Consolidating workflows within a single platform simplifies monitoring, troubleshooting, and process optimization.
- **Implement Vendor-Agnostic, Modular Tools**: Using modular tools that don’t restrict innovation allows organizations to evolve with changing needs and avoid limitations of existing systems.
- **Enable Real-Time Monitoring for All Teams**: Real-time insights empower teams to optimize resources, improve performance, and quickly address disruptions, ensuring a reliable and efficient operational environment.

## Why Kestra? A Step Toward Unified, Collaborative Operations

![dashoboard](/blogs/2024-10-30-ops-everything/dashboard.jpg)

At [**Kestra**](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra), we’re working to build this **unified approach**, creating an orchestration platform that meets operational needs across data and engineering. Our customers [**Gorgias**](https://kestra.io/use-cases/stories/13-gorgias-using-declarative-data-engineering-orchestration-with-kestra) and [**Leroy Merlin France**](https://kestra.io/use-cases/stories/14-achieving-agility-and-efficiency-in-data-architecture-with-kestra) underscore the transformative potential of unified workflows. Gorgias integrates Kestra with tools like **Airbyte**, **dbt**, and **Hightouch**, optimizing Infrastructure as Code practices, while Leroy Merlin relies on Kestra to support its **data mesh**, giving business units orchestration access without shadow IT.

Kestra’s approach is adaptable and vendor-neutral, allowing organizations to scale operations on their terms, with open standards and modular integration. Moving from fragmented tools to Kestra empowers teams across domains to follow Ops best practices, delivering cohesive, resilient workflows.

A **unified platform** is the future of Ops — scalable, transparent, and open to collaboration. Consider [**Kestra**](https://kestra.io/) as a step toward flexible orchestration for diverse workflows, designed to ensure teams can work together effectively while building on best practices across domains.
