[Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) is, by design, language-agnostic, offering the flexibility to write scripts in your preferred language. We recognize that Python is among the most widely used languages.

However, Kestra employs a declarative language for creating flows, and embedding large Python scripts directly into YAML files may not always be ideal. This approach works well for simpler scripts, but for more complex Python scripts, a cleaner solution is needed.

One way around is to **store your scripts on GitHub**. Kestra can then download and run these scripts, allowing you to modify them on the fly without needing to adjust the actual flow.

Alternatively, **Kestra's new code editor** enables you to write and execute Python scripts directly from the Kestra UI.

Today, we'll explore both methods in detail. But first, let's develop a complex Python script to demonstrate its functionality.

## Writing a Long Python Script for Web Scraping

So, what will our "complex" Python script do? 

In a nutshell, it will scrape a website and organize the results in a Pandas DataFrame. We'll leverage a website that was designed for beginners to learn web scraping - [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/).

It has books organized into categories, as you can see from the following image:

![Image 1 - Books to scrape website](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/1.png)

Clicking on an individual book opens up a whole new world of things to scrape:

![Image 2 - Individual book](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/2.png)

And that's just what we'll do. Since this isn't a web scraping article, we'll only provide a high-level overview of the scraping logic. We have a file named `scraper.py` which implements the following functions:
- `get_books()` - It accepts a list of topics and then iterates over them, constructs n URL, and uses the `BeautifulSoup` Python package to scrape the website. Once scraped, it extracts properties such as book title, link, thumbnail link, rating, price, and availability. Some of the properties might be missing, and we've taken that into account. Finally, books are organized into a Pandas DataFrame and returned to the user.
- `main()` - Declares a list of book topics and calls the `get_books()` function with them. Once done, it saves the returned Pandas DataFrame as a CSV file.

If you prefer code over text, here's an entire code snippet:

```python
import requests
import datetime
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from collections import OrderedDict

def get_books(topic_list):
    # Generate full URLs from the argument provided by user
    all_urls = []
    for topic in topic_list:
        all_urls.append('http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/{}/index.html'.format(topic))

    # Instantiate an empty list for holding the dictionary objects
    all_books = []

    # Inform the user that the scraping has started, and when it started
    start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    print('Book Scraping in Progress... Time Started: {}'.format(datetime.datetime.strftime(start_time, '%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S')))
    
    # Iterate over every URL 
    for url in all_urls:
        # Fetch HTML from it
        page = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'lxml')
        
        # Topic can be extracted from the URL itself 
        # I've also removed everything that isn't necessary - '_2' from 'travel_2' for example
        curr_topic = url.split('/')[-2].split('_')[0]

        # article tag is your starting point, as discussed earlier
        books = soup.find_all('article', attrs={'class': 'product_pod'})

        # For every article tag on the webpage
        for book in books:
            # Initialize the variables so the error isn't thrown if data isn't found
            book_title = ''
            book_link = ''
            thumbnail_link = ''
            rating = ''
            price = ''
            availability = ''

            # Check if title exists - if does, update book_title
            if book.find('h3').find('a') != None:
                book_title = book.find('h3').find('a').get('title')

            # Check if link exists - if does, update book_link and thumbnail_link
            if book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'image_container'}).find('a') != None:
                base_book_url = 'http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/'
                book_url = book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'image_container'}).find('a').get('href')
                book_link = base_book_url + book_url.split('../')[-1]

                base_thumbnail_url = 'http://books.toscrape.com/'
                thumbnail_url = book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'image_container'}).find('img').get('src')
                thumbnail_link = base_thumbnail_url + thumbnail_url.split('../')[-1]

            # Check if rating exists - if does, update rating
            if book.find('p', attrs={'class': 'star-rating'}) != None:
                rating = book.find('p', attrs={'class': 'star-rating'}).get('class')[-1]

            # Check if price and availability exists - if does, update them
            if book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'product_price'}) != None:
                price = book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'product_price'}).find('p', attrs={'class': 'price_color'}).get_text()
                availability = book.find('div', attrs={'class': 'product_price'}).find('p', attrs={'class': 'instock availability'}).get_text().strip()

            # Append the list with Ordered Dictionary from those variables
            all_books.append(OrderedDict({
                'Topic'        : curr_topic,
                'Title'        : book_title,
                'Rating'       : rating,
                'Price'        : price,
                'Availability' : availability,
                'Link'         : book_link,
                'Thumbnail'    : thumbnail_link
            }))
          
    # Inform the user that scraping has finished and report how long it took
    end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    duration = int((end_time - start_time).total_seconds())
    print('Scraping Finished!')
    print('\tIt took {} seconds to scrape {} books'.format(duration, len(all_books)))
    
    # Return Pandas DataFrame representation of the list
    return pd.DataFrame(all_books)

def main():
    # List of topics from which the books will be scraped
    topics = ['travel_2', 'mystery_3', 'historical-fiction_4', 'classics_6', 'philosophy_7']
    # Scrape and return a DataFrame
    books = get_books(topic_list=topics)
    # Save as CSV
    books.to_csv('books.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

As you can see, navigating through nested HTML elements is messy, and you definitely don't want to copy-paste this script into Kestra's plain YAML flow code. There are much better ways.

But first, let's test the script next to ensure it works properly.

### Testing the Script
You can run the `scraper.py` file from CMD/Terminal, depending on the operating system you're using.

Here's what we got printed to the console:

![Image 3 - Running the Python script](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/3.png)

The script has scraped 81 books in 3 seconds, and supposedly saved the results into a CSV file.

You'll see this file in the same place where your Python script is located:

![Image 4 - Output file](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/4.png)

It looks like everything worked, so let's bring this logic to Kestra next.



## Approach #1 - Running the Script from GitHub
In this section, you'll learn how to have your Python scripts living on GitHub, and also how to connect Kestra to a GitHub repo.

### Creating a Repository
First things first, you'll want to create a `requirements.txt` file. It will store all the **Python dependencies** needed to run the script.

You can check the Python package versions manually, or simply copy everything from the below snippet:

```text
requests==2.26.0
pandas==2.0.3
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
lxml==4.9.3
```

Now create a new GitHub repository and copy both files to it. You should end up with something like this:

![Image 5 - Contents of a GitHub repo](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/5.png)

And that's it! You're now ready to create a new Kestra flow.

### Writing and Running the Kestra Flow
We've created a new Kestra flow that uses the `io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory` plugin.

You'll want to use the `io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone` plugin to clone a GitHub repository locally (to Kestra). Just remember to specify your GitHub repo URL in this task.

Further, we're using a `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands` task instead of `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script`, since we technically have the script downloaded and stored on Kestra's storage. Also, make sure to install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file, and then just run the Python file:

```yaml
id: pythonScriptFromGit
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: workingDirectory
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
    - id: cloneRepository
      type: io.kestra.plugin.git.Clone
      url: https://github.com/darioradecic/kestra-python
      branch: main
    
    - id: pythonScript
      type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
      warningOnStdErr: false
      docker:
        image: ghcr.io/kestra-io/pydata:latest
      beforeCommands:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt > /dev/null
      commands:
        - python scraper.py
```

And here's what your editor's content should look like:

![Image 6 - Contents of the Kestra editor](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/6.png)

You can run it, and this time you'll see three green bars. The additional bar in the middle represents the task of cloning the GitHub repo:

![Image 7 - Running the Kestra flow](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/7.png)

You can further inspect the contents of the `Logs` tab. It will show you the same success message seen in the previous section, while we were testing the script locally:

![Image 8 - Kestra flow logs](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/8.png)

The biggest benefit of running Python script this way is that you or anyone else from your team can **modify the Python code** on the fly, without the need to do any modification on Kestra's end. Let's see that in action next.

### What Happens If You Change the Python Code?
To demonstrate, we've decided to add a couple more book categories to the Python file. Nothing fancy or groundbreaking, but you should end up with a couple of more scraped books:

![Image 9 - Modified Python code](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/9.png)

The best part is that you can now simply re-run the Kestra flow and leave the flow YAML file identical to what it was.

As you can see, the Python script has now **scraped a total of 141 books instead of 81**, which means Kestra was able to detect the change on a Python script stored on GitHub:

![Image 10 - Reruning the Kestra flow](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/10.png)

If you ask us, that's the true power of separating code logic from data flows - scalability.

Up next, you'll learn how to run Python scripts using our new code editor.


## Approach #2 - Writing the Script with Kestra Editor

To start using it, click on the `Editor` tab in the sidebar navigation, and choose your namespace from the dropdown menu:

![Image 11 - Kestra editor tab](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/11.png)

After a couple of seconds of initializations, you'll be presented with a familiar-looking interface - well, at least if you've used [Visual Studio Code](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/kestra-visual-studio-code-extension-your-favourite-data-orchestration-platform-just-got-better-ba87c35fe678) before:

![Image 12 - Contents of the embedded VSCode editor](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/12.png)

The contents of the `_flows` folder are a topic to discuss some other time, so leave it untouched. Everything you do Python-wise will have to be stored in a new folder named, let's say `scripts`. 

Let's go through the process next.


### Writing the Python Script
To start, create a new folder `scripts` inside the root directory, and create a Python file named `scraper.py` inside it.

Once the Python file is opened, paste the contents of our web scraping script. Here's what it should look like:

![Image 13 - Adding the script file](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/13.png)

And that's it! Just make sure the Python file is saved, and you're ready to use it in your workflows.


### Writing and Running the Kestra Flow
If this is your first time using the new editor to run Python scripts, don't worry, **most of your Kestra logic can remain unchanged**.

You still need to use the `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script` plugin, but now, instead of pasting the script directly into YAML, you can leverage the new `{{ read('<path>/<to>/script.py') }}` syntax.

Don't forget to include `beforeCommands` to install the necessary Python dependencies. Your code may (and likely will) fail otherwise.

Here's the full source code:

```yaml
id: pythonScriptFromEditor
namespace: dev

tasks:
  - id: workingDirectory
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:
      - id: pythonScript
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
        beforeCommands: 
          - pip install requests==2.26.0 pandas==2.0.3 beautifulsoup4==4.12.2 lxml==4.9.3
        script: "{{ read('scripts/scraper.py') }}"
```

Your YAML flow file now looks extra tidy:

![Image 14 - Using Python script in a Kestra flow](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/14.png)

As before, save the flow and run it by clicking on the purple "Execute" button. You'll see the following in the `Gantt` view:

![Image 15 - Running the flow](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/15.png)

**So, why are the bars orange?** The answer is simple - we got a warning message while installing Python libraries saying pip commands shouldn't be run by the root user: 

![Image 16 - Examining the logs](/blogs/2023-11-20-advanced-python-scripts/16.png)

It's a warning you can safely ignore. It doesn't affect the runtime in any way.

Below the warning message, you'll also see that 81 books were scraped successfully - the exact same output we had in the previous sections.

And that's two ways to run complex and lengthy Python scripts in your Kestra flows. Let's make a brief recap next.


---

## Summing up Complex Python Scripts in Kestra
In a nutshell, **don't ever write more than a few lines of Python code into a Kestra YAML file**. You won't get syntax highlighting or code completion, and your YAML file will get unnecessarily long and messy.

You have two excellent alternatives you'll be thankful for in the long run - **GitHub** and the new **built-in editor**.

The prior assumes you're hosting your script files in a GitHub repo. That way, you'll make your flow YAML files shorter and easier to read, and you or your team will be able to make changes to the scripts without needing to change anything on Kestra's end.

The latter allows you to write and edit Python code straight from the Kestra UI, and then just call the scripts through a `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script` plugin.

**Whichever one you choose, you won't go wrong.**
