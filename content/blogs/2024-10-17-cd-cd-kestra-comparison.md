In a recent [blog post](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we defined what an orchestrator is, the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when should you choose an orchestrator over a CI/CD solution? Both have overlapping functionality so how do you decide which one is best for your job?

In this article, we'll explore what CI/CD tools are, dive into some of the most popular ones, and look at what Kestra brings to the table. In particular, we'll also provide a deeper comparison between Kestra and Jenkins.

## What Are CI/CD Tools?
Before comparing CI/CD tools, let's first define what is a CI/CD tool.

CI/CD tools are software applications that automate the processes of integrating code changes (Continuous Integration) and deploying applications (Continuous Deployment) to production environments. They help teams collaborate effectively by automating builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring that new features and bug fixes are delivered quickly and reliably.

By automating these steps, CI/CD tools reduce the reliance on manual intervention, which not only accelerates the development cycle but also minimizes the potential for human error. Automation, in fact, ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable, eliminating mistakes that can occur when developers have to remember and execute complex sequences manually.

In particular, CI/CD tools are designed to:

- **Automate builds**: Compile source code into executable programs, saving developers time and minimizing manual errors.
- **Run tests**: Execute automated tests to verify that code changes work as intended and don't introduce new bugs, providing early feedback and maintaining code quality.
- **Deploy applications**: Automatically release new code to production or staging environments, allowing teams to ship features faster and with fewer manual interventions.
- **Provide feedback**: Alert developers about build statuses and test results, helping them identify and address issues as soon as possible.

These tools are fundamental for maintaining high-quality code and rapid release cycles in today's fast-paced development environments. By removing manual steps and standardizing workflows, they enhance reliability and reduce the chance of errors slipping into production. So, without them, teams would struggle to keep up with the demand for frequent updates, making it much harder to maintain a competitive edge.

## Most Used CI/CD Tools
There are a lot of CI/CD tools out there, so let's take a closer look at some of the most popular ones. For each, we'll provide an overview, highlight a unique feature, and list pros and cons.

### GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is GitHub's integrated CI/CD solution, allowing you to automate your workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It enables you to build, test, and deploy your code right alongside your pull requests and issues, providing a seamless experience for developers.

Also, by integrating tightly with GitHub, it reduces context switching, allowing teams to manage their entire CI/CD pipelines within a single interface; this makes GitHub Actions particularly attractive for teams that want to quickly implement automation without having to leave their existing GitHub environment.

## Why Kestra Stands Out
After exploring these popular CI/CD tools, you might be wondering where Kestra fits in. So, let's dive into what makes Kestra unique and when it might be the right choice for your projects.

### Kestra: Orchestrating Complex Workflows With Ease
Kestra is an open-source orchestration and scheduling platform designed to handle complex workflows across various systems. While traditional CI/CD tools focus on automating code integration and deployment, Kestra specializes in orchestrating tasks that span multiple environments and services.

Here are its unique capabilities:

- **Unified orchestration across systems**:  Kestra allows you to manage workflows involving different cloud providers, databases, APIs, and more â€” all from a single platform. This makes it easier to coordinate tasks that need to interact with diverse environments, reducing the need for custom integration scripts.
- **Real-time event triggers**: Supports event-driven architectures, enabling workflows to react to events like file uploads, database changes, or API calls. This [real-time](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.m) responsiveness can be critical for applications that require immediate action.
- **Visual workflow editor**: Provides an intuitive interface to design and visualize workflows, reducing complexity and making it accessible even for those new to orchestration. This visual approach can save significant time when designing and maintaining workflows.
- **Robust error handling and retries**: Built-in mechanisms for managing failures and retries without the need for custom scripting, ensuring reliability. This is a must when dealing with critical tasks where failure isn't an option.

### When to Choose Kestra Over Traditional CI/CD Tools
At this point, you might be wondering when to choose Kestra over a CI/CI tool. So here are some guidelines to consider:

- **Complex, multi-system workflows**: If your workflows involve coordinating tasks across various platforms and services, Kestra simplifies this orchestration. Instead of relying on multiple CI/CD jobs and scripts, Kestra provides a unified approach.
- **Event-driven processes**: For applications that need to respond to real-time events, Kestra's event triggers are invaluable. This capability allows your workflows to start automatically when something happens, without manual intervention.
- **Enhanced error handling**: When reliability is critical, Kestra's robust error management ensures workflows can recover gracefully, reducing downtime and manual troubleshooting.
- **Visual design preference**:  If you prefer designing workflows visually rather than scripting them, Kestra's editor is a significant advantage. The ability to drag and drop tasks can make workflow creation much more approachable.
- **Scalability needs**: For projects that require handling large-scale data processing or distributed tasks, Kestra is built to scale efficiently. It takes care of distributing tasks across available resources, so you don't have to manage scaling manually.

## Kestra Vs. Jenkins: A Deep Comparison
So, along this article, we've described what are CI/CD tools used for and we listed the most popular ones. We have also presented Kestra as an orchestration tool and described when to choose it over traditional CI/CD tools.

As Jenkin is a "jack of all trade" CI/CD tool, here we want to make a deep comparison between it and Kestra to help you understand why and when you should choose Kestra over it. To do so, we'll discuss why developers use Jenkins and difficulties in using it that Kestra solves.

### Why Developers Use Jenkins
Jenkins has many pros, and we believe the three that are woth mentioning are:

1. **Wide Adoption and Ecosystem**: Jenkins has been around for over a decade, so it is mature and "battle-tested": this makes it a staple in continuous integration and deployment. Also, its vast plugin ecosystem and open-source nature make it adaptable for almost any CI/CD pipeline need.

2. **Flexibility**: With Jenkins, developers can create highly customized pipelines as it supports different environments, tools, and languages.

3. **Community Support**: Jenkins has an active community that ensures thereâ€™s a large amount of documentation, tutorials, and forums where developers can find answers to their problems.

Now, let's see where Jenkins falls short.

### Difficulties Developers Encounter Using Jenkins
While Jenkins is a powerful tool, it does come with some challenges.

### Ease of Use and Developer Experience
One of Kestraâ€™s standout features is its intuitive interface which provides built-in autocomplete and detailed error handling: this helps developers quickly define and manage their workflows without getting bogged down by tedious setup processes.

Unlike Jenkins, which can be slow and challenging to configure, Kestraâ€™s interface accelerates the workflow-building experience, allowing developers to focus more on building their systems rather than troubleshooting pipeline syntax or configuration issues.

In fact, in Jenkins debugging pipelines can be difficult to set up as logs can become scattered across different plugins and stages, making it hard to trace the root cause of an issue.

Kestra, instead, provides centralized logging and error-handling across all tasks in a workflow. So, if a pipeline fails, developers can easily view the entire execution history and debug issues with a unified logging system.

#### Groovy Syntax
Jenkins uses [Groovy-based](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/groovy/) scripting for pipeline creation, which can be unintuitive for developers unfamiliar with it - as it also a language not widely used. This can create a steep learning curve that can slow down development and cause errors.

Kestra, instead, uses a declarative YAML-based syntax that is much easier to read and write. YAML is also widely known and used in the industry, making it more accessible to developers, and reducing the learning curve for new users. Its human-readable format makes YAML a practical choice, as it is straightforward to understand, allowing team members across different roles to easily collaborate on workflow definitions.

#### Scalability Challenges
Jenkins requires a lot of manual setup for distributed builds or scaling across [multiple nodes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/nodes/), and this can lead to bottlenecks when the infrastructure needs to grow.

In contrast, Kestra leverages [Worker Groups](../docs/06.enterprise/worker-group.md), which are collections of workers that can be targeted for executing tasks based on specific requirements, allowing for efficient workload distribution across different nodes. Additionally, [Task Runners](../docs/06.enterprise/task-runners.md) enable the dynamic allocation of tasks in various cloud environments, facilitating the execution of compute-intensive jobs without the need for permanent infrastructure.

These features provide streamlined and scalable approach to managing complex workflows, reducing the operational overhead associated with scaling Jenkins.

## Conclusions
In conclusion, selecting a CI/CD tool depends on your project's unique needs. In particular, to summarize:

- GitHub Actions is perfect for projects entirely on GitHub, minimizing context switching.
- GitLab CI/CD suits teams wanting everythingâ€”from code to deploymentâ€”in one place.
- Azure DevOps is tailored for those deep into the Microsoft ecosystem.
- CircleCI offers speed and efficiency for fast-paced development environments.
- Jenkins provides unmatched flexibility for those ready to handle its complexity.

However, when your workflows become complex and span multiple systems or require real-time event handling, these tools might not suffice. In such cases, Kestra stands out by seamlessly orchestrating complex workflows across diverse platforms, offering robust error handling, and scaling effortlessly. So, for most modern applications that demand more than what traditional CI/CD tools offer, Kestra provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies complexity and accelerates development.
