## Improved Scheduling and Backfills

The scheduling system in Kestra has received a major upgrade, improving performance and usability. Changes in the Scheduler enabled significant improvements in the backfill functionality, making it easier to manage and execute backfills directly from the UI.

### Backfills from the UI
You can now trigger backfills directly **from the UI**, specifying the **start and end dates** for the period you want to cover. This **API-first** feature eliminates the need to edit source code to execute backfills, significantly simplifying the process without disrupting your deployment patterns. No more Terraform state conflicts due to backfill changes in the source code!

Moreover, backfills are now more flexible — they can be paused or cancelled at any time. You can also add custom execution labels to your backfills, making it easier to track why a backfill process was started. For more details on this feature, check out the new [Backfill documentation](/docs/concepts/backfill).

</div>

### Recover Missed Schedules
Speaking of backfills, Kestra 0.15.0 [introduces](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2219) a new configuration allowing you to choose whether you want to automatically backfill missed schedules on server startup or not. This gives you more control over your scheduled executions, especially after a planned maintenance window or an outage. The `recoverMissedSchedules` configuration can be set to `ALL`, `NONE` or `LAST`, and can be defined globally for all flows or within a specific flow. For more information, check out the [Recover Missed Schedules](/docs/workflow-components/triggers#recover-missed-schedules) documentation.


### Schedule conditions are now unified with trigger conditions

To make the configuration more consistent, we've unified the `scheduleConditions` with the generic trigger `conditions`.

Note that as a result of this change, the `scheduleConditions` property is marked as deprecated; **simply rename it to `conditions` to future-proof your flows**.

This change is implemented in a **non-breaking** way, so you don't need to immediately change your existing flows in order to successfully migrate to 0.15.0. However, the `scheduleConditions` property will be removed in the future.

For more details and examples, check out the [Schedule Conditions](/docs/migration-guide/schedule-conditions) migration guide.

## Trigger Enhancements

This release also introduces several improvements to triggers, adding a new toggle for disabling and re-enabling triggers, a new `http.Trigger` feature, and a new `NONE` action for file detection triggers. Additionally, all triggers now have a new `stopAfter` property, and the HTTP trigger and the HTTP Request task now support automatic encryption and decryption of outputs.

### New Toggle for Disabling and Re-enabling Triggers

You can now disable and re-enable triggers directly from the UI without having to modify the source code. This feature is particularly useful for managing triggers during maintenance or when you need to temporarily pause a trigger. Additionally, you can now see the status of each trigger and unlock it when needed with a single click from the Trigger tab on the Flow's detail page.

You can read more about this functionality in the [Trigger documentation](/docs/workflow-components/triggers).

![trigger_toggle](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/trigger_toggle.png)

### The `NONE` Action in File Detection Triggers
We've added a new type of action to **file detection triggers**, offering more control over how you can process recently detected files. When setting the action to `NONE`, the trigger will not move nor delete the file, allowing you to manually manage the file after it has been processed within the execution.

Here is an example of how you can use the `NONE` action with an S3 trigger:

```yaml
id: s3_process_new_files
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: for_each_file
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.EachSequential
    value: "{{ trigger.objects | jq('.[].key') }}"
    tasks:
      - id: process_file
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
        runner: DOCKER
        commands:
          - echo "processing file {{ taskrun.value }}"

      - id: delete_after_processing
        type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.s3.Delete
        key: "{{ taskrun.value }}"

triggers:
  - id: watch
    type: io.kestra.plugin.aws.s3.Trigger
    interval: "PT1M"
    prefix: "data/"
    action: NONE # ⚡️ this is the new action

taskDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.aws
    values:
      accessKeyId: "{{ secret('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}"
      secretKeyId: "{{ secret('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}"
      region: us-east-1
      bucket: my-bucket
```

The `action: NONE` property allows you to _manually_ move or delete the file after it has been processed. The `taskDefaults` property is used to avoid duplicating the AWS credential configuration across multiple tasks and triggers from the AWS plugin.

For more details on the `NONE` action, check out:
- the plugin documentation e.g. [S3 Trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/triggers/s3/io.kestra.plugin.aws.s3.Trigger), [GCS Trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-gcp/triggers/gcs/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.gcs.Trigger), [Azure Blob Storage Trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-azure/triggers/storage.blob/io.kestra.plugin.azure.storage.blob.trigger), and [SFTP Trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-fs/triggers/sftp/io.kestra.plugin.fs.sftp.trigger)
- the GitHub issues [#1842](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/1842) and [#262](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-gcp/issues/262).

### New HTTP Trigger

Thanks to the recently introduced [HTTP Trigger](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-fs/triggers/http/io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.trigger), your workflows can be initiated based on specific conditions in the HTTP response. This feature is particularly useful for integrating Kestra with external APIs. Example use cases include:
- anomaly detection,
- monitoring the stock or price of a product and sending an alert when the value drops below a certain threshold,
- or triggering a workflow whenever a specific condition is met in your custom APIs.

### The `stopAfter` trigger property

Kestra 0.15.0 introduces the `stopAfter` property allowing triggers to be automatically disabled after a success or failure. You can use this property in all triggers, including the new HTTP trigger:

```yaml
id: send_alert_when_price_drops
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: slack
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: "{{ secret('SLACK_WEBHOOK') }}"
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#general",
        "text": "The price is now below the threshold: {{ json(trigger.body).products[0].price }}"
      }

triggers:
  - id: http
    type: io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.Trigger
    uri: https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=macbook-pro
    responseCondition: "{{ json(response.body).products[0].price < 1800 }}"
    interval: PT30S
    stopAfter:
      - SUCCESS
```

Check the [trigger documentation](/docs/workflow-components/triggers) for more details on how to use the `stopAfter` property.

### Automatic Encryption and Decryption of HTTP Task Outputs

For maximum security, the HTTP trigger and the HTTP Request task now additionally support an automatic encryption and decryption of outputs. This [feature](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-fs/pull/100) ensures that sensitive data is protected both in transit and at rest. To enable encryption, set the `encryptBody` [boolean flag](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-fs/triggers/http/io.kestra.plugin.fs.http.trigger#encryptbody) to `true`. Also, make sure to configure the `kestra.encryption.secret-key` in your [Kestra configuration](/docs/configuration-guide/encryption).

## Subflow Management

Subflows behave like functions in a programming language. They can encompass reusable logic providing modularity across many complex workflows. However, until now, passing data between subflows and their parent flows has been challenging.

### Subflow Outputs
From this release on, `flows` can emit strongly typed `outputs` by key. This way, the parent flow doesn't need to know the internals of a subflow in order to access its outputs. Instead, the subflow can return output values, just as functions do in any programming language. This change significantly improves the UX of passing data between subflows and their parent flows.

Here is a simple example to illustrate how subflows can emit strongly typed outputs:

```yaml
id: hello
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: mytask
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: hey there

outputs:
  - id: myval
    type: STRING
    value: "{{ outputs.mytask.value }}"
```

And here is a parent flow that can consume the output of the subflow by the key `myval`:

```yaml
id: parent
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: subflow
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.Subflow
    flowId: hello
    namespace: company.team
    wait: true

  - id: log_subflow_output
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ outputs.subflow.outputs.myval }}"
```

🚨 Keep in mind that you need to **set the `wait` property to `true` in the `Subflow` task** to enable passing data between flows because parent flow needs to wait for the subflow to finish before it can use its outputs.

::alert{type="warning"}
As a result of the new flow `outputs` feature, the `outputs` property of a `Subflow` task is deprecated. To pass data between flows, use flow `outputs` as shown in the example above. If you have many subflows passing data between each other and you need more time for the migration, you can add a configuration flag to keep the old behavior. Check the [migration documentation](/docs/migration-guide/subflow-outputs) for more details.

### Subflow Termination from the Parent Flow

We've also [enhanced](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/2970) how subflow executions can be terminated. Specifically, terminating a parent flow will now also end all its associated subflows. However, you can also terminate both parent and child executions independently.

## Secrets Management

Secrets management has been further improved in this release, with the introduction of SECRET type inputs and [new functions](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/2892) for encrypting and decrypting data. Additionally, the UI now allows for easy [deletion of logs](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/3002) for specific task runs, helping quickly address any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

![secrets_delete_sensitive_logs](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/secrets_delete_sensitive_logs.png)

[Some outputs](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/3005) such as [GCP](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-gcp/pull/324) or [ECR](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws/pull/373) tokens are now automatically encrypted and decrypted.

## New UI Features

### Stats Page

The Kestra UI continues improving the user experience. A notable addition is the new [Stats page](../docs/01.getting-started/14.ui.md#stats), which provides a comprehensive overview of executions, flows, namespaces, and triggers at a glance.

![Stats Page](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/stats_ee.png)

In the open-source edition, this page enables configuring basic authentication for the Kestra instance directly from the UI.

![basic_auth](/docs/user-interface-guide/stats_oss.png)


### New Design of UI Tabs and Pagination

The UI tabs and pagination display have been redesigned for easier navigation. Additionally, you can now filter by `absolute` or `relative` time ranges.

![ui_changes_in_0_15](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/ui_changes_in_0_15.png)

Lastly, the `Save` and `Actions` buttons have been moved to a dedicated UI menu for improved navigation:

![editor_display](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/editor_display.png)

---

## New plugins

With this release, we're introducing [Azure EventHubs](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-azure#eventhubs) and [Solace](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-solace) plugins, which extend the integration capabilities for event-driven architectures. These plugins open up new possibilities for data processing and event handling within your workflows.

We've also added a new generic Singer plugin that simultaneously integrates with all [taps](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-singer/tasks/taps/io.kestra.plugin.singer.taps.generictap) and [targets](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-singer/tasks/targets/io.kestra.plugin.singer.targets.generictarget), thereby significantly expanding the range of data sources and destinations that can be declaratively orchestrated in Kestra using the Singer ecosystem.

---

## Enterprise Edition Updates

For Enterprise Edition users, we've added a new [Setup page](/docs/enterprise/setup) in the UI, showing the most important configuration options and streamlining the setup process for a new Kestra instance. That setup wizard will guide you through the initial configuration of your instance, making it easier to get started.

![ee_setup_page](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/ee_setup_page.png)

We've also revamped the RBAC system, with improved handling of Superadmin access. There is also a dedicated UI page called Access allowing you to configure tenant-level RBAC.

![access_page](/blogs/2024-02-29-release-0-15/access_page.png)

The new **Service Accounts UI page** allows you to create and manage [service accounts](/docs/enterprise/service-accounts), and we've introduced API tokens valid for a specific period of time, allowing you to grant programmatic access to Kestra for Users and Service Accounts. This feature is particularly useful for CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Terraform, as well as for using the API token in API calls.

![service_account_create](/docs/user-interface-guide/service_account_create.png)

---

## Other Enhancements

### New `id` Property for Inputs

The `inputs` property now uses `id` instead of `name` for consistency with the rest of the Kestra flow configuration. This change is implemented in a non-breaking way, so you don't need to immediately change your existing flows in order to successfully [migrate to 0.15.0](/docs/migration-guide/inputs-name). The `name` property will be removed in the future.

### New `ENUM` Input Type

Speaking of inputs, we've added a new `ENUM` input type that will ensure valid user inputs matching a predefined list of values.

### Organization Blueprints are now Custom Blueprints

We've renamed Organization blueprints to Custom blueprints to better reflect their purpose — they are used to create custom sharable configuration of flows, tasks, and triggers, even if they are used only on a single tenant within the organization.

### Micronaut 4 Migration

Kestra 0.15.0 migrates to Micronaut 4.3. Check the [migration guide](/docs/migration-guide/micronaut4) for more details on how you can migrate your custom plugins.

### Change in Concurrency Control with the Kafka Runner

If you're on the Kestra Enterprise Edition with a Kafka backend, make sure that all executions that use concurrency limits terminate (_they must finish or you need to manually kill them_) before upgrading to 0.15.0. This is due to a fix implementing concurrency limits without `ExecutionQueued`. To efficiently drain all your executions, you can stop the Webserver and the Scheduler, and then wait for the Executor and the Worker to finish pending executions. Once all executions are finished, you can upgrade to 0.15.0.
