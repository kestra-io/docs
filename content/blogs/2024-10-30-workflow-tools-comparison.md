When it comes to automating and managing complex workflows, choosing the right workflow orchestration tool makes a massive difference for your company. As this can simplify your processes or complicate them further, depending on how well it fits your needs. Making an informed decision is essential to ensure the success of your workflows and the overall efficiency of your team.

But with so many orchestration tools available, how do you decide which one is the best fit for your needs?

In this article, we'll walk through what makes a workflow orchestration tool, how to pick one, and compare the three popular choices to help you make an informed decision that aligns with your needs, both present and future.

## What is a Workflow Orchestration Tool?

A workflow [orchestration tool](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md) is software that automates the execution, monitoring, and management of tasks in a defined order across multiple systems or applications. It simplifies and schedules the complex processes behind the scenes, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level business logic rather than managing the infrastructure.

These tools are particularly useful for building and managing pipelines, automating business processes, and running batch operations. They ensure reliability by handling task retries in case of failures, provide fault tolerance to avoid disruptions, and deliver scalability to grow with your needs. This is especially important when dealing with large-scale distributed environments, where managing tasks manually would be impractical and error-prone.

For example, consider a scenario where a data engineering team at a global retail company needs to process terabytes of sales data generated daily from multiple regions, in various formats, and from different sources like POS systems, online transactions, and third-party vendors. Manually managing the ETL processes to extract this data, transform it (e.g., currency conversion, time zone adjustments, data cleaning, and so on), and load it into a centralized data warehouse would be highly error-prone. A workflow orchestration tool, on the other hand, can automate these complex pipelines as it can schedule tasks, manage dependencies, handle failures with retries or alerts, and scale resources based on workload, ensuring timely and accurate data processing.

Another example to consider can be in the field of [CI/CD](./2024-10-17-cd-cd-kestra-comparison.md) pipelines for a microservices architecture. Imagine an engineering team responsible for a large-scale application composed of hundreds of microservices, each developed and maintained by different teams. Coordinating the build, test, and deployment processes for each service manually would be chaotic. A workflow orchestrator, instead, can automate the entire CI/CD pipeline by triggering builds when code is committed, running unit and integration tests in parallel across different services, deploying services in the correct order to avoid dependency issues, and rolling back automatically if a deployment fails. This ensures consistent and reliable software releases, reduces manual intervention, and accelerates the development lifecycle.

## How to Choose a Workflow Orchestration Tool?

When choosing the best workflow orchestration tool for your needs, it’s important to think beyond just the immediate needs of your project. The tool you're choosing, in fact, should not only be a good fit for today's needs: it also must be able to scale with your future workflows.

So, here’s a look at the key factors I would consider when making your choice:

- **Ease of use**: How easy is it to get started with the tool? This doesn’t just mean a smooth installation: it extends to the entire user experience. A good workflow orchestration tool should have an intuitive interface, so that managing and monitoring workflows doesn’t feel like rocket science. 
- **Flexibility**: Your workflow orchestration tool needs to adapt to different environments and data sources. Some tools might be great if you're working entirely in the cloud, but what if your workflows span cloud and on-premises infrastructure? Or, what if you’re dealing with a variety of databases, APIs, and batch-processing systems? The right tool should support a broad range of integrations and have the flexibility to handle different types of workloads — from real-time data pipelines to periodic batch jobs. Flexibility also means how easy it is to adjust workflows as requirements change, so you should ask yourself: "With this tool, can I add new tasks or integrate a new data source without overhauling the entire workflow?"
- **Scalability**: Workflows start small but can get complex fast. You need a tool that can scale not just with more tasks, but with higher volumes of data and a growing number of dependencies. Does the tool you're analyzing support distributed execution so it can handle multiple tasks in parallel across nodes? Does it continue performing well as the number of workflows increases, or does it slow down? For example, tools with native cloud support (or that are cloud-native) often scale better because they’re designed to handle large-scale, distributed workloads.
- **Extensibility**: At some point, you’ll probably need a feature that isn’t supported out of the box. So, in this context, extensibility refers to how easily you can extend or customize the orchestration tool to meet your specific needs. This could be writing custom plugins, integrating with proprietary systems, or creating custom monitoring solutions, and a highly extensible tool offers hooks or APIs that allow you to build on top of it. 
- **Community & Support**: Even the most powerful tools can feel like a dead end without a strong community or good support. An active user community means you’ll find plenty of resources — whether it’s documentation, tutorials, open-source plugins, or quick answers to your questions. Large communities are also a good sign that the tool is actively maintained and will continue evolving. Also, if your company is likely to need more personalized support, check if the tool offers a managed or enterprise version with dedicated support channels: this can be a critical aspect when you’re dealing with production issues and need timely resolutions.

## Comparing Popular Workflow Orchestration Tools

Let's now take a closer look at three widely used workflow orchestration tools: Apache Airflow, Prefect and Kestra. Each one excels in specific areas, so understanding their strengths can help you choose the one that is the best fit for your needs:

- Apache Airflow is best suited for data engineering teams deeply integrated with Python, particularly when managing intricate ETL pipelines. Its DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflow management provides precise control over task execution sequences, which is essential for accurate data processing. Airflow, in particular, excels in scenarios where the order of operations is important and teams are comfortable with Python-based workflow definitions.

- Prefect is designed for Python developers who require a tool with a focus on hybrid execution models. It performs well in environments where workflows involve sensitive data that must remain on-premises while still leveraging external orchestration capabilities. It's particularly suitable for small teams or projects that need to get up and running quickly without extensive infrastructure investments.

- Kestra is particularly well-suited for organizations that need to orchestrate complex, large-scale workflows across a variety of systems and technologies. For example, if your team deals with diverse data sources — such as different databases, APIs, cloud services, and on-premises systems — and needs to integrate them seamlessly, Kestra's flexibility makes it an excellent choice. In particular, it's ideal for environments where workflows are not just about data pipelines but also involve automating business processes, running batch operations, and managing tasks that span multiple departments or technologies.

Let's now describe each tool, by providing an overview, a unique feature, and pros and cons to help you get a better understanding for your choice.

## Apache Airflow
![Airflow UI](/blogs/2024-10-30-workflow-tools-comparison/airflow-UI.png)

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is one of the most well-known and widely used workflow orchestration tools. Built by Airbnb and now part of the Apache Software Foundation, Airflow excels at managing workflows in Python with a strong focus on ETL pipelines. It also provides a highly customizable solution for engineers familiar with Python and is widely used in the data engineering and analytics domains.

**Unique feature: DAG-based workflow management**

Airflow uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to define task dependencies, which is useful for data pipelines requiring specific execution sequences. DAGs, in fact, allow users to visualize the entire workflow structure, understand task dependencies, and control the execution order with precision: this feature is important for workflows focused on data engineering, where task order is crucial for processing data accurately. 

**Pros**:
- **Large community and ecosystem**: With its long-standing presence, Airflow has amassed a large community and an extensive ecosystem. Numerous plugins and resources are available, making it easy to find solutions, tutorials, and pre-built connectors for common use cases.
- **Customizability**: Airflow offers full flexibility to define workflows using Python, making it a preferred choice among Python developers. 

**Cons**:
- **Scaling challenges**: Airflow's dependence on a centralized database can lead to performance bottlenecks as workloads grow. This can create a single point of failure, and as workflows increase in number and complexity, scaling becomes challenging
- **Python-based**: Airflow’s reliance on Python means that non-Python developers might face a steep learning curve, limiting its accessibility for mixed-skill teams. On the counter, this might be a positive if your tech stack is heavily based on Python.
- **Older architecture**: Airflow was not designed with cloud-native principles in mind, so its older architecture may require additional effort to adapt to modern cloud-native use cases.

### Prefect

![Prefect UI](/blogs/2024-10-30-workflow-tools-comparison/prefect-UI.png)

[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is an open-source orchestration tool that offers both self-hosted and cloud-based solutions, providing flexibility in deployment. Workflows in Prefect are defined using Python, which makes it easy for data professionals to integrate them into existing Python-based projects.

**Unique feature: hybrid execution model**

Prefect's hybrid model separates orchestration from execution: this improves security by keeping sensitive data within your infrastructure, while leveraging cloud-based orchestration. This model offers a balance between control and convenience, allowing organizations to manage sensitive workflows internally while benefiting from external orchestration capabilities.

**Pros**:
- **Flexible execution model**: Prefect supports running workflows in a variety of environments — locally, in the cloud, or in a hybrid setup — without requiring changes to workflow code. This flexibility is ideal for organizations that need a mix of cloud and on-premises execution for different parts of their infrastructure.
- **Simplified infrastructure**: Compared to Airflow, Prefect's setup is more straightforward, reducing the initial overhead required to get started. This ease of deployment helps teams quickly get up and running, making Prefect a convenient choice for smaller projects or teams without dedicated infrastructure resources.

**Cons**:
- **Limited compared to DAGs**:  While simpler, Prefect's workflows lack some of the robustness and fine-grained control offered by Airflow's DAGs, particularly when dealing with highly complex data pipelines with multiple interdependencies.
- **Python-centric**: Prefect, like Airflow, is also Python-centric, which means teams that are not familiar with Python may find it challenging to use. Again, this might be a benefit if your tech stack is primarily Python based. 

### Kestra
![Kestra UI](/blogs/2024-10-30-workflow-tools-comparison/kestra-UI.png)

[Kestra](https://kestra.io/) is a modern, distributed orchestration tool built for handling complex workflows at scale. With a focus on scalability and high availability, Kestra is optimized for modern cloud environments and is designed with a cloud-native architecture, making it a great fit for systems that need to scale seamlessly as demands grow. Moreover, it enables users to build workflows either by coding in YAML or directly through its intuitive user interface, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical users and fostering collaboration across different teams.

**Unique feature: language-agnostic workflows**

Kestra provides YAML-based workflow definitions which make it a language-agnostic tool. This means that teams can use Kestra regardless of their preferred programming language, making it easy to adopt across different departments or tech stacks. This flexibility allows for greater collaboration across teams and makes it an excellent fit for organizations that want a standardized workflow tool without needing programming skills focused on a particular language.

Also, note that this helps prevent lock-in to a specific technology stack. By defining workflows in YAML, in fact, you ensure that your orchestration layer remains decoupled from your application code. This means you can evolve or change your tech stack down the line without being constrained by your orchestrator. For example, if your organization decides to transition from a Python-based stack to a Go or a Rust one, your existing Kestra workflows remain compatible. This flexibility, not only future-proofs your workflows, but also reduces the overhead associated with migrating to new technologies, allowing your engineering team to adapt quickly to industry advancements without rewriting orchestration logic.

**Pros**:
- **Highly available scheduler**: Kestra’s scheduler is designed for high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that workflows can continue running even if parts of the system experience failures. This means no single point of failure disrupts task execution, making Kestra ideal for mission-critical applications where reliability and uptime are crucial. 
- **Flexible database backends**: One of Kestra’s standout features is its support for multiple database backends. This flexibility allows users to choose the backend that best fits their performance, scalability, and integration needs
- **Modern design**:  Built with cloud-native architectures in mind, Kestra embraces modern design principles, such as microservices and distributed computing, to optimize performance in dynamic environments. Its architecture supports horizontal scaling across multiple nodes, making it easy to add capacity as workflows grow.

**Cons**:
- **Smaller community**: Being newer on the market, Kestra may have a smaller user base with respect to other tools. Though, is rapidly growing and very active.

## Why Kestra Stands Out
Let's now explore the aspects that make Kestra stand out.

### Unified Development and Deployment Platform
Kestra provides a unified platform that streamlines the entire workflow lifecycle — from design and testing to deployment and monitoring — within a single, cohesive environment. This integrated approach allows teams to:

- Iteratively build and refine workflows directly in the user interface, enabling rapid prototyping with immediate visual feedback.
- Test workflows in real-time, ensuring they perform as expected before moving them into production environments.
- Promote workflow code seamlessly to production, keeping it version-controlled and aligned with existing deployment practices without added friction.

By offering an integrated platform, Kestra reduces the barriers between different stages of the workflow lifecycle.

### Language-Agnostic
While Airflow and Prefect heavily rely on Python code to define workflows, Kestra offers a language-agnostic approach using YAML. This allows teams without programming expertise to create and manage workflows through declarative configurations, enhancing collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This approach simplifies maintenance and reduce the likelihood of errors, as workflows are defined through straightforward YAML configurations that are easier to read and write. 

Additionally, Kestra's declarative syntax with YAML seamlessly integrates with different tech stacks like [Python](../docs/15.how-to-guides/python.md), [Go](../docs/15.how-to-guides/golang.md) and [Rust](../docs/15.how-to-guides/rust.md). This means that engineers can write custom tasks and plugins in their preferred languages and incorporate them directly into their workflows. This flexibility allows teams to leverage existing codebases and expertise across various programming languages, fitting seamlessly into diverse engineering environments and enabling the use of different tools for specific needs.

### Natively Highly Scalable and Distributed Architecture

Kestra is built from the ground up with scalability and high availability in mind, leveraging technologies like [Kafka and Elasticsearch](../docs/07.architecture/index.md) to distribute workloads efficiently. Its architecture allows for horizontal scaling, ensuring that the system can handle increasing volumes of tasks and data without performance degradation.

So, with its distributed design, Kestra provides seamless scalability out of the box, making it well-suited for enterprises with demanding workloads and the need for reliable, high-performance orchestration.

### Advanced Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

Kestra provides sophisticated error handling mechanisms and fault tolerance features that enhance the reliability of workflows. It supports complex [retry strategies](../docs/04.workflow-components/12.retries.md), [conditional execution paths](../docs/15.how-to-guides/conditional-branching.md), and [dynamic handling of failures](../docs/03.tutorial/06.errors.md) to ensure that workflows can recover gracefully from errors.

With these features, Kestra reduces the need for custom error-handling code, simplifies workflow definitions, and improves the overall system robustness.

### Native Cloud Features

Kestra is built from the ground up with [cloud-native](/use-cases/modern-data-stack) principles in mind, making it a natural fit for modern cloud environments. Its architecture seamlessly leverages containerization and orchestration technologies, which means it can scale efficiently, manage resources effectively, and integrate smoothly with cloud infrastructures.

On the other hand, while both Prefect and Airflow have made strides in supporting cloud deployments, they were not originally built with a cloud-native mindset, and this can lead to complexities during setup and management.

## When to Choose Kestra Over Airflow and Prefect

So, considering all this knowledge how do you choose Kestra over Airflow or Prefect? 

Well, here are some considerations to keep in mind:
- **Choose Kestra for general-purpose workflows across diverse technologies**: If your team deals with a wide range of tasks — from automating business processes to integrating various systems and technologies — Kestra's language-agnostic workflows and intuitive UI make it accessible to engineers and non-engineers alike. Its cloud-native architecture ensures scalability and high availability, making it ideal for organizations that need to orchestrate complex, large-scale workflows. For instance, a multinational corporation automating cross-departmental processes, such as coordinating marketing campaigns with sales data and inventory management, would benefit from Kestra's flexibility and ease of use.
- **Choose Prefect for data workflows requiring hybrid execution models**. If your projects involve sensitive data that must remain on-premises while still leveraging cloud-based orchestration, Prefect's hybrid execution model is a strong fit. It's particularly suitable for teams that prefer Python and need to get up and running quickly without extensive infrastructure setup. For example, a healthcare analytics company needing to process patient data securely on-premises while orchestrating workflows through a cloud service could leverage Prefect to balance security with convenience.
- **Choose Apache Airflow for data workflows that require precise control over task execution sequences**. Airflow's DAG-based workflow management is excellent for data engineering teams deeply integrated with Python, especially when the focus is on managing intricate ETL pipelines in a specific order of executionl. If your team needs to handle complex dependencies and requires full flexibility in defining workflows using Python code, Airflow is a robust choice. For instance, a financial institution processing transaction data with strict compliance requirements might use Airflow to ensure that data transformations occur in a specific, auditable sequence.

## Conclusion

When it comes to choosing the right workflow orchestration tool, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution: the best tool depends on your specific needs, including the complexity of your workflows, scalability requirements, and your team's expertise.

Kestra, however, stands out as the strongest option for modern, cloud-native environments. Unlike Airflow which can struggle with scaling and has a steeper learning curve, or Prefect which may lack some robustness in complex workflows, Kestra strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and power. Its language-agnostic approach and intuitive UI, in fact, make it accessible for teams of all sizes and skill levels, while its highly scalable architecture ensures that it can handle even the most demanding workflows, allowing you to grow without worrying about managing infrastructure.
