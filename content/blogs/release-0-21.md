Kestra 0.20.0 is here, introducing multiple highly requested features to your favorite open-source orchestration platform. This release adds new flow and task properties, such as `sla` and `runIf`, and new Flow trigger `preconditions` bringing advanced time-driven dependencies across flows.

Enterprise Edition users can now benefit from more team-level isolation, a new invite process, and custom UIs to interact with Kestra from the outside world using Apps.
