We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new feature in Kestra Enterprise Edition: **Apps**. With Apps, you can create custom user interfaces on top of your Kestra workflows. This feature makes it possible for anyone‚Äînot just technical users‚Äîto interact with your flows directly by submitting data, approving tasks, or viewing outputs, allowing you to build self-service applications for your data products and business processes.

## What Are Apps

Apps act as a **front end** for your Kestra workflows. They allow users to interact with workflows through forms, approval buttons, and other UI components, while Kestra handles all the backend processing.

With Apps, you can:
- Create forms that submit data to workflows
- Build approval interfaces for paused workflows
- Display workflow outputs or logs enabling your stakeholders to validate data quality and request data they need for reporting and analytics in a self-serve manner.

In short, Apps let you turn any Kestra workflow into a user-facing application.

## Why Use Apps

Workflows often require input from non-technical users who need to validate some data processing steps and decide on approval status. Traditionally, building such interfaces required a lot of effort‚Äîwriting frontend code, connecting to APIs, validating user inputs, and handling security and permissions. Apps eliminate all that complexity. You can configure a custom UI for your workflows in just a few lines of declarative YAML configuration, and Kestra takes care of the rest.

Here are some examples of what you can do with Apps:
- **Approval Workflows**: approve or reject workflows provisioning resources or validating data.
- **Data Requests**: let your stakeholders request datasets they need and download them directly from the app as a self-service.
- **Feedback Forms**: collect feedback, or handle signups for events.
- **IT Tickets**: users can submit bug reports or feature requests, which will be routed to the appropriate team to resolve the issue.

## Use Cases for Apps

Currently, Kestra supports two main use cases with Apps:

1. **Form Apps** ‚Äî users submit data to workflows by entering custom parameter values. When they press the `Submit` button, Kestra initiates a new workflow execution.

2. **Approval Apps** ‚Äî users can approve or reject paused workflow executions. The workflow resumes or stops based on their decision.

Both of them are built using the `Execution` app type. Read more about [available App types in our docs](https://kestra.io/docs/enterprise/apps).

More app types are on the way. If you have a use case in mind, [let us know](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Carea%2Fbackend%2Carea%2Ffrontend&projects=&template=feature.yml)!

## Managing Access and Permissions

You can control who has access to your apps:

- **Public Access**: Anyone with the app‚Äôs URL can use it.

- **Private Access**: Only authorized users with specific permissions can access the app.

This flexibility makes Apps suitable for both internal tools and public-facing forms.

---

## Getting Started with Apps

To create an app, start by designing a workflow in Kestra. For example, let‚Äôs create a workflow that allows users to request and download datasets:

```yaml
id: get_data
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: data
    displayName: Select Data to Download
    type: SELECT
    values: [customers, employees, products, stores, suppliers]
    defaults: customers

  - id: startDate
    displayName: Start Date for your dataset
    type: DATE
    defaults: 2024-1=r2-03

tasks:
  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/resolve/main/ion/{{ inputs.data }}.ion

outputs:
  - id: data
    type: FILE
    value: "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"
```

Save that flow.

Then, use the `Apps` page to configure a custom UI for that workflow.

Go to the `Apps` page and click on `+ Create`. Then, paste the app configuration shown below.

::collapse{title="Expand for the App code"}
```yaml
id: request_data_form
type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.Execution
displayName: Form to request and download data
description: This app will request data and provide it for download.
namespace: company.team
flowId: get_data
access: PRIVATE
tags:
  - Reporting
  - Analytics

layout:
  - on: OPEN
    blocks:
      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Markdown
        content: |
          ## Request data
          Select the dataset you want to download.
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.CreateExecutionForm
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.CreateExecutionButton
        text: Submit

  - on: RUNNING
    blocks:
      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Markdown
        content: |
          ## Fetching your data...
          Don't close this window. The results will be displayed as soon as the processing is complete.

      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Loading
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.Logs
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.CancelExecutionButton
        text: Cancel request

  - on: SUCCESS
    blocks:
      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Markdown
        content: |
          ## Request processed successfully
          You requested the following dataset:

      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.Inputs

      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Alert
        style: SUCCESS
        showIcon: true
        content: Your data is ready for download!

      - type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.apps.execution.blocks.Outputs

      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Markdown
        content: Find more App examples in the linked repository

      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Button
        text: App examples
        url: https://github.com/kestra-io/examples/tree/main/apps
        style: INFO

      - type: io.kestra.ee.apps.blocks.Button
        text: Submit new request
        url: "{{ app.url }}"
        style: DEFAULT
```
::

Click on `View App` to see it in action:

![image2.png](/blogs/introducing-apps/image2.png)

You will see a new tab that should look as follows:

![image3.png](/blogs/introducing-apps/image3.png)

Fill out the form and click on `Submit`. Once processing is complete, you should see this page:

![image4.png](/blogs/introducing-apps/image4.png)

The UI display and all actions performed by the app are configurable through `blocks` specified in the `layout` property.

By clicking on the `View App` button, your end users can use the app directly, or you can share the link with your end users. If access is set to `PUBLIC`, your app link will be visible to anyone in the world! üåç
