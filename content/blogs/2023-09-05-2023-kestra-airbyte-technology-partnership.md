We are pleased to announce a technology partnership with [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/). Kestra and Airbyte share a common vision for the future of the Modern Data Stack. This technical partnership ensures seamless data transfer, task execution, and process automation between Kestra and Airbyte.

>“Airbyte and Kestra share a common vision: to simplify data pipeline creation. This partnership brings together the strengths of two leading data management companies, so our customers can get the most out of their data and achieve their business goals.”

*Chris Tata Head of Partnerships @ Airbyte*

With technology partners like Airbyte, we're able to cover more use cases in our existing framework. By integrating with Airbyte, Kestra can provide an open technology stack that can integrate, transform, process, and move data at any scale.

>“Kestra excels at orchestrating data pipelines, and often the most challenging part of this is the initial data integration, a stage where Airbyte shines. The collaboration between Kestra and Airbyte, both open-source platforms, is a natural fit as we share a common mission: to simplify and optimize data solutions for business users.”

*Ludovic Dehon CTO @ Kestra*

### Kestra's Airbyte Plugin ###
Kestra's [plugin for Airbyte](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-airbyte) enables users to trigger Airbyte syncs and optionally, wait for their completion. Whether you use the open-source Airbyte Server or Airbyte Cloud, Kestra can integrate your data ingestion process into an end-to-end data workflow.

### Embracing Everything as Code with Kestra and Airbyte ###
Our collaboration highlights an innovative approach to data management—treating everything as code. The partnership strengthens the ability to automate data operations and infrastructure deployment, which means you can now manage, modify, and scale your data pipelines more efficiently.

- **Everything-as-Code Approach**: Manage data operations like code, fostering collaboration, and efficient scaling. More insights can be found in this detailed blog post on everything-as-code for data infrastructure.

- **Terraform Providers Integration**: Both platforms offer strong Terraform support, enabling you to manage and provision resources using declarative configuration files.
