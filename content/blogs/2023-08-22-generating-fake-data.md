Welcome to the world of [Shiny Rocks](https://github.com/kestra-io/shiny_rocks)! Although this company might not exist outside [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) it has its own purpose.

We often face the challenge of presenting concepts without real data, due to privacy concerns or practicalities.

Shiny Rocks is a fictional company creating smartphones. "Those shiny rocks in our pockets". It provides a means to showcase various data use cases in a realistic manner. In this post, we are not just introducing this mock company, but also offering datasets it "produces" for your hands-on experience. Plus, in the future, anticipate more of Shiny Rocks; it's going to be our gimmick to bring plausible data scenarios, especially when we dive deep into use cases with Kestra.

You can find the whole use case in our [live demo in the shiny_rocks namespace](https://demo.kestra.io/ui/flows?namespace=shiny_rocks).

## Generating fake data ##

Unlike static files that don't change, Shiny Rocks comes with custom scripts that generate fresh data every day. These scripts rely on a mix of mathematical functions to simulate various trends for our imaginary company.

Here is for example the mathematical function used to generate orders volume over a year.

![Function](/blogs/2023-08-22-generating-fake-data/function.png)

To create those fake data, we lean on the Faker python library, supplemented by our custom provider. 

Our datasets include:
- Orders: Like any order table, detailing user orders.
- Payments: Lists payments related to orders, also linking to affiliate marketing sources.
- Services: Illustrates the services users access on their smartphones - maps, contacts, music, etc.

By using distribution functions, we've given these datasets diverse and random attributes.

For example we want two products, one being present in 64% of orders and the other in 36% of them. We do the same with marketing UTM sources, payment methods, product service usages, etc...

```python
class ShinyRockProvier(BaseProvider):

    def order(self, order_date):
        return {
            "user_id": uuid.uuid4().hex,
            "order_id": uuid.uuid4().hex,
            "order_date": order_date,
            "product_id": int(select_string({"3": 0.64, "5": 0.36})),
                        "utm_source": select_string({"_instagram": 0.2, "_amazon": 0.6, "_facebook": 0.1, "_youtube": 0.1})
        }

    def payment(self, order_id, product_id, order_date):
        return {
            "payment_id": uuid.uuid4().hex,
            "order_id": order_id,
            "order_date": order_date,
            "payment_method": select_string({"PAYPAL": 0.17, "CARD": 0.80, "APPLE_PAY": 0.03}),
            "amount": product_id * 99
        }

    def service(self, user_id, product_id, run_date):
        return {
            "service_id": select_string({"MAPS": 0.3, "MUSIC": 0.4, "PHONE": 0.1, "MESSAGE": 0.2}),
            "user_id": user_id,
            "product_id": product_id,
            "duration": get_random_number(range_a=5, range_b=3600),
            "run_date": run_date
        }
```

Then with Kestra we schedule a Flow to generate those data every day.

We first create a working directory to make every task accessing the same storage space. Then we start by cloning the shiny rocks GitHub repository and run the Python main program to generate data.

Note the {{ trigger.date ?? now() | date("yyyy-MM-dd")}}:
- when running on schedule it will take the corresponding scheduled date
- when running manually it will take the current date.

We declare a scheduling trigger every day with a backfill property allowing us to run the Flow over several past dates. 

```yaml
id: produce_data
namespace: shiny_rocks
description: |
  This flow generate Shiny Rocks fictional data. Three datasets are created: `orders`, `payments` and `services`.
  Like in reality, those data change everyday.

labels:

  - id: working_dir
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.flows.WorkingDirectory
    tasks:

      - id: clone

      - id: python
        type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
        warningOnStdErr: false
        beforeCommands:
          - pip install -r dataset/produce/requirements.txt
        commands:
          - python dataset/produce/main.py --date {{ trigger.date ?? now() | date("yyyy-MM-dd")}}

      - id: file_outputs

    cron: "0 10 * * *"
    backfill:

```

## ELT Across Platforms ##

Once data are created we extract them in Google Cloud Storage and load them for further processing in Big Query.
Note, this is just our choice for this demo. Kestra integrates with Snowflake, AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery, Postgres, MySQL, DuckDB (MotherDuck) and many more.

```yaml
id: load_orders_bigquery
namespace: shiny_rocks
description: |
  When data are generated upstream, this flow ingest the `orders` data into Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery.

labels:
  tag: load

inputs:
  - name: orders_data
    type: URI

  - name: order_date
    type: DATE

tasks:

  - id: extract
    type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.gcs.Upload
    serviceAccount: '{{ secret("gcp_creds") }}'
    from: "{{ inputs.orders_data }}"
    to: gs://shiny_rocks/app_log/orders/{{ inputs.order_date }}/orders.csv

  - id: load
    type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery.LoadFromGcs
    from: 
      - "{{ outputs.extract.uri }}"
    projectId: "kestra-dev"
    destinationTable: "shiny_rocks.orders"
    serviceAccount: '{{ secret("gcp_creds") }}'
    format: CSV
    autodetect: true
    csvOptions:
      fieldDelimiter: ","
    timePartitioningField: "order_date"

triggers:

  - id: get_data
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    inputs:
      orders_data: "{{ outputs.file_outputs.uris['orders.csv'] }}"
      order_date: "{{ outputs.run_date.value }}"
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionFlowCondition
        namespace: shiny_rocks
        flowId: produce_data
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionStatusCondition
        in:
          - SUCCESS
```

Here the first task upload input CSV files coming from our previous Flow to Google Cloud Storage. Then we load this data into a BigQuery table.
You can find more information about the secret function used in the above example in the [dedicated documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/secrets).

## Integrating Marketing Data ##
Shiny Rocks doesn't just produce products; it also (fictionally) invests in marketing campaigns. Managed in a Google Spreadsheet, this data becomes integral when evaluating ROI. To ensure comprehensive analysis, we transfer this spreadsheet data into our primary data warehouse.

The following Flow directly reads the Google Spreadsheet and loads it into a proper BigQuery table.

```yaml
id: marketing_investments_to_bigquery
namespace: shiny_rocks
description: |
  The marketing teams manage their investments into a Google Spreadsheet, hence we load those data into BigQuery for further processing and join with other data.

labels:
  tag: marketing

variables:
  spreadsheet_id: 1C0UWuMuiEIxkOKzSQhbhFn6AILzmXX59NUbtI4s3wpU
  dataset_table: shiny_rocks.marketing_investments

tasks:
  - id: read_gsheet
    type: io.kestra.plugin.googleworkspace.sheets.Read
    description: Read data from Google Spreadsheet
    serviceAccount: "{{ secret('gcp_creds') }}"
    spreadsheetId: "{{ vars.spreadsheet_id }}"
    store: true
    valueRender: FORMATTED_VALUE
  
  - id: write_csv
    type: io.kestra.plugin.serdes.csv.CsvWriter
    description: Write CSV into Kestra internal storage
    from: "{{ outputs.read_gsheet.uris.marketing }}"
  
  - id: load_biqquery
    type: io.kestra.plugin.gcp.bigquery.Load
    description: Load data into BigQuery
    serviceAccount: "{{ secret('gcp_creds') }}"
    autodetect: true
    writeDisposition: WRITE_TRUNCATE
    csvOptions:
      fieldDelimiter: ","
    projectId: kestra-dev
    destinationTable: '{{ vars.dataset_table }}'
    format: CSV
    from: "{{ outputs.write_csv.uri }}"

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Schedule
    cron: "0 10 * * *
```

When every data has been loaded into our data warehouse we trigger a dbt run to model our data. You can find the dbt project inside the shiny rocks [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kestra-io/shiny_rocks/tree/main/shiny_rocks_dbt). We use the SIM data model (Staging, Intermediate, Mart, also known as the Medallion architecture) as explained in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview#guide-structure-overview).
This Flow is triggered when the three upstream dependencies are in success on the last running day.

```yaml
id: dbt_run
namespace: shiny_rocks
description: |
  Whenever all data are loaded in BigQuery, this flow will run a dbt job to transform data.

## Orchestrating Analytics Initiative ## 

The marketing team wants to know how much their ad campaigns drive sales or not. They asked the data team for a daily report showing the ROI of each platform.

To do so, data-engineers created a Kestra Flow that:
Retrieves data from the mart table in BigQuery, merging sales and marketing investment insights.
Run a python script generating a chart.
Delivers this chart via email to the marketing team, ensuring they're always updated on campaign performances.

```yaml
id: marketing_roi_chart
namespace: shiny_rocks
description: |
  After dbt transformation, we use marketing data joined to orders to create a plot of marketing ROI.
  The flow first query data from BigQuery and then run a Python script to read data and create a chart out of it.
  Then it sends this chart by email to the marketing team.

## Conclusion ##

For those who wish to dive deeper, we have made the entire [Shiny Rocks project available for your exploration and usage](https://github.com/kestra-io/shiny_rocks). 

Feel free to access the data and use it as a base for your projects or demos. These "plausible" datasets can be invaluable for learning, testing, and showcasing various tools and concepts.
You can also look at [our live demo](https://demo.kestra.io/ui/flows?namespace=shiny_rocks) where you could find all Flow showcased here running everyday in the shiny_rocks namespace.

Stay tuned, as Shiny Rocks will make appearances in some of our future posts, giving you even more real-world-like scenarios to delve into with Kestra.
