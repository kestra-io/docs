We're thrilled to announce Kestra 0.16.0 which adds a new way to deploy your code to various remote environments, including a.o. Kubernetes, AWS Batch, Azure Batch, and Google Batch. We also introduce flow-level retries, new tasks, and UI improvements.

Let's dive into the highlights of this release.

## Task Runners: run your code anywhere

Until Kestra 0.15.11, you could configure the script tasks to run in local **processes** or in **Docker containers** by using the `runner` property.

Kestra 0.16.0 introduces a new `taskRunner` property that provides more flexibility than  `runner` and allows you to deploy your code to various remote environments, including [Kubernetes](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-kubernetes/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.kubernetes.runner.kubernetestaskrunner), [Docker](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/task-runners/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.dockertaskrunner),
 [AWS Batch](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-aws/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.aws.runner.awsbatchtaskrunner), [Azure Batch](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-azure/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.azure.runner.azurebatchtaskrunner), [Google Batch](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-gcp/task-runners/runner/io.kestra.plugin.gcp.runner.gcpbatchtaskrunner), and more coming in the future. Since each `taskRunner` type is a plugin, you can create your own and if you wish, you can contribute it to our open-source codebase.

One of the key advantages of Task Runners is that **they make it easy to move from development to production**. Many Kestra users develop their scripts locally in Docker containers and then run the same code in a production environment on a Kubernetes cluster. Thanks to task runners, setting this up is a breeze. Below you see an example showing how you can combine `taskDefaults` with the `taskRunner` property to use Docker in the development environment and Kubernetes in production — all without changing anything in your code.

1. Development namespace/tenant/instance:

    ```yaml
    taskDefaults:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts
        values:
          taskRunner:
            type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.runner.docker.DockerTaskRunner
            pullPolicy: IF_NOT_PRESENT # in dev, only pull the image when needed
            cpu:
              cpus: 1
            memory:
              memory: 512Mi
    ```

2. Production namespace/tenant/instance:

    ```yaml
    taskDefaults:
      - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts
        values:
          taskRunner:
            type: io.kestra.plugin.kubernetes.runner.KubernetesTaskRunner
            namespace: kestra-prd
            delete: true
            resume: true
            pullPolicy: ALWAYS # Always pull the latest image in production
            config:
              username: "{{ secret('K8S_USERNAME') }}"
              masterUrl: "{{ secret('K8S_MASTER_URL') }}"
              caCert: "{{ secret('K8S_CA_CERT') }}"
              clientCert: "{{ secret('K8S_CLIENT_CERT') }}"
              clientKey: "{{ secret('K8S_CLIENT_KEY') }}"
            resources: # can be overriden by a specific task if needed
              request: # The resources the container is guaranteed to get
                cpu: "500m" # Request 1/2 of a CPU (500 milliCPU)
                memory: "256Mi" # Request 256 MB of memory
    ```

We envision task runners as a pluggable system allowing you to **run any code anywhere** without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Flow-level retries

You can now set a **flow-level retry policy** to restart the execution if any task fails. The retry `behavior` is customizable — you can choose to:
1. Create a new execution
2. Retry the failed task only.

Flow-level retries are particularly useful when you want to retry the entire flow if _any_ task fails. This way, you don't need to configure retries for each task individually.

Here's an example of how you can set a flow-level retry policy:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: myteam

retry:
  maxAttempt: 3
  behavior: CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION # RETRY_FAILED_TASK
  type: constant
  interval: PT1S

tasks:
  - id: fail_1
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.executions.Fail
    allowFailure: true

  - id: fail_2
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.executions.Fail
    allowFailure: false
```

The `bahavior` property can be set to `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` or `RETRY_FAILED_TASK`. Only with the `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` behavior, the `attempt` of the **execution** is incremented. Otherwise, only the failed **task run** is restarted (incrementing the attempt of the task run rather than the execution).

Apart from the `behavior` property, the `retry` policy is _identical_ to the one you already know from task retries.

## Additions to the Core

### New Toggle task to enable or disable a trigger

Sometimes, you may want to programmatically enable or disable a trigger based on certain conditions. For example, when a business-critical process fails, you may want to automatically disable a trigger to prevent further executions until the issue is resolved. The [new](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2717) `Toggle` task allows you to do just that via a simple declarative task.

```yaml
id: disable_schedule
namespace: dev
tasks:
  - id: disable_schedule
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.triggers.Toggle
    namespace: dev
    flowId: http
    triggerId: http
    enabled: false # true to reenable
```

### TemplatedTask

[Since Kestra 0.16.0](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2962), you can use the `TemplatedTask` task which lets you fully template all task properties using Pebble so that they can be dynamically rendered based on your custom inputs, variables, and outputs from other tasks.

Here is an example of how to use the [TemplatedTask](https://kestra.io/plugins/tasks/templating/io.kestra.core.tasks.templating.templatedtask) to create a Databricks job using dynamic properties:

```yaml
id: templated_databricks_job
namespace: dev

inputs:
  - id: host
    type: STRING
  - id: clusterId
    type: STRING
  - id: taskKey
    type: STRING
  - id: pythonFile
    type: STRING
  - id: sparkPythonTaskSource
    type: ENUM
    defaults: WORKSPACE
    values:
      - GIT
      - WORKSPACE
  - id: maxWaitTime
    type: STRING
    defaults: "PT30M"

tasks:
  - id: templated_spark_job
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.templating.TemplatedTask
    spec: |
      type: io.kestra.plugin.databricks.job.CreateJob
      authentication:
        token: "{{ secret('DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN') }}"
      host: "{{ inputs.host }}"
      jobTasks:
        - existingClusterId: "{{ inputs.clusterId }}"
          taskKey: "{{ inputs.taskKey }}"
          sparkPythonTask:
            pythonFile: "{{ inputs.pythonFile }}"
            sparkPythonTaskSource: "{{ inputs.sparkPythonTaskSource }}"
      waitForCompletion: "{{ inputs.maxWaitTime }}"
```

Note how in this example, the `waitForCompletion` property is templated using Pebble even though that property is not dynamic. The same is true for the `sparkPythonTaskSource` property. Without the `TemplatedTask` task, you would not be able to pass those values from inputs.

### New pebble functions to process YAML

Related to the templated task, there are [new Pebble functions](/docs/concepts/expression/filter/yaml) to process YAML including the `yaml` and `indent` functions that allow you to parse and load YAML strings into objects. Those objects can then be further transformed using Pebble templating.

Big thanks to [kriko](https://github.com/kriko) for [contributing this feature](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/pull/3283)!

### ExecutionLabelsCondition

Thanks to the new `ExecutionLabelsCondition` condition, [you can now](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2720) trigger a flow based on specific execution labels. Here's an example:

```yaml
id: flow_trigger_with_labels
namespace: prod.myteam

tasks:
  - id: run_after_crm_prod
    type: io.kestra.core.tasks.debugs.Return
    format: "{{ trigger.executionId }}"

triggers:
  - id: listenFlow
    type: io.kestra.core.models.triggers.types.Flow
    conditions:
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionNamespaceCondition
        namespace: prod
        comparison: PREFIX
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionStatusCondition
        in:
          - SUCCESS
      - type: io.kestra.core.models.conditions.types.ExecutionLabelsCondition
        labels:
          application: crm
```

The above flow will only be triggered after an execution:
- from a `prod` namespace,
- with the status `SUCCESS`,
- with the label `application: crm`.

## Improvements to the secret function

The `secret()` function now returns `null` if the secret cannot be found. [This change](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3162) allows you to fall back to an environment variable if a secret is missing. To do that, you can use the `secret()` function in combination with the [null-coalescing](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/expression/operator#null-coalescing) operator as follows:

```yaml
accessKeyId: "{{ secret('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') ?? env.aws_access_key_id }}"
```


## UI Improvements

### Outdated revision warning

To avoid conflicts when multiple users are trying to edit the same flow, we now [raise a warning](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2953) if you edit an outdated version. This way, you can be sure that you're always working on the latest revision.

### Saved search filters

You can now save your search filters on the Executions page. This feature is particularly useful when you have complex search queries that you want to reuse.

::div
<iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynIYqMC1T00?si=dsq7wTEjUn1kO8Z9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
::

Note that the **name** of the search filter can be at most 15-characters-long.

For now, the saved search is only local, i.e. it's available only to the user who created it. In the near future, we plan to make saved search filters shareable across your organization, so you can easily collaborate with your team members.

Big thanks to Yuri for [contributing this feature](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/1397)!

### Default page size

When you change the page size on any UI page containing a table, it will be saved and used as the default page size for all tables. This enhancement is useful when you have a large number of executions and want to see more or fewer executions per page.

![page_size](/blogs/2024-04-12-release-0-16/page_size.png)

### File and variable outputs stored immediately

Outputs (both files and variable outputs) generated in script tasks are [now stored immediately](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2407), rather than only after a successful task completion. This change makes outputs accessible from the Outputs tab in the UI as soon as they are generated, providing maximum visibility into your workflow execution.

You will now also see the outputs of failed tasks (i.e. outputs generated up to the point of failure) in the Outputs tab, making troubleshooting easier.

### Better trigger display

We've improved the trigger display in the UI. Instead of only [showing the first letter](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2789), we now display a friendly icon for each trigger type.

![better_trigger_display](/blogs/2024-04-12-release-0-16/better_trigger_display.png)

Disabled triggers are now greyed out in the topology view even when they are disabled only via an API call without changing the source code to help you identify which triggers are currently active.

### New Welcome page

The new Welcome page provides a quick overview of the necessary steps to get started with Kestra. It includes links to the documentation, plugins, guided tour and to the Slack community.

## Plugin Enhancements

### New Docker Run task

We've [added](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/1283) a new `docker.Run` task that allows you to execute Docker commands directly from your flows. While Kestra runs all script tasks in Docker containers by default, the new `docker.Run` task gives you more control over the commands you want to run. For example, this new task doesn't include any interpreter, so you have the maximum flexibility to run any command from any Docker image you want.

Here's an example:

```yaml
id: docker
namespace: myteam

tasks:
  - id: docker_run
    type: io.kestra.plugin.docker.Run
    containerImage: docker/whalesay
    commands:
      - cowsay
      - hello
```

### Git Push username and password

By default, the `git.Push` task pushes all commits as a root user. With the new `author` property, [you can now](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-git/issues/43) create personal commits with your username and email.

### Authenticate to AWS services using IAM Role

We've added the option to [authenticate](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-aws/issues/348) with AWS services using IAM Roles. This addition is particularly useful when you don't want to manage access keys e.g. on AWS EKS Kestra deployments.

### dbt plugin profile

When you set a custom dbt `profile` property, that profile set within your Kestra task configuration will now be used to run your dbt commands even if your dbt project has a `profiles.yml` file. [This change](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-dbt/pull/102) is particularly useful for moving between environments without having to change your dbt project configuration in your Git repository.

### IBM AS400 and DB2 plugins

We've added support for [IBM AS400](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-jdbc/issues/248) and thus DB2 databases. You can now interact with IBM AS400 and [DB2 databases](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-jdbc-db2) using the `db2.Query` task and the `db2.Trigger` trigger.


## Enterprise Edition Enhancements

### Cluster Monitor dashboard

We've added a (georgeous!) new cluster monitoring dashboard to the Enterprise Edition. This dashboard provides an overview of your instance health, including the status, configuration and metrics of all worker, executor, scheduler and webserver components.

Using this dashboard, you can centrally monitor your instance health and quickly identify any issues that need attention without having to rely on any additional observability tools.

![cluster_health_dashboard](/blogs/2024-04-12-release-0-16/cluster_health_dashboard.png)

### Default roles

We've added **predefined roles** to the Enterprise Edition, including Admin, Editor, Launcher, and Viewer. These roles help standardize user permissions and access control in your organization. Additionally, you can now assign a default role that will be automatically applied to new users unless a specific role is assigned.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that you will only see the new predefined roles in tenants created after upgrading to Kestra 0.16.0.
