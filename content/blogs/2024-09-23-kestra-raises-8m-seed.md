## Why We Built Kestra: Bridging the Orchestration Gap

Existing tools often solve specific needs—whether it's automating data pipelines, managing IT tasks, or coordinating business processes—but they **tend to operate in silos**. These siloed solutions introduce complexity, demand specialized skills, and ultimately create unnecessary risks, where what’s needed is efficiency, transparency, and reliability.

At Kestra, we recognized this gap and set out to build a **unified orchestration platform** that simplifies workflows across any infrastructure, cloud, or application. Our vision was to create an orchestration tool that engineers love to use, **one that breaks down barriers** and scales seamlessly.

## Simplifying Complexity, Elevating Workflows

Kestra is designed to simplify complexity. With a **declarative**, **language-agnostic** framework, an **API-first** approach, and our **Everything as Code and from the UI or following GitOps** philosophy, Kestra is intuitive yet incredibly powerful. It’s a platform engineers can adopt quickly, customize extensively, and rely on for any workflow, no matter how complex.

## A Platform Without Limits

Kestra isn’t just another orchestration tool. It’s a platform built to handle workflows of **any type, across any domain**.

And we’re not stopping there. We continue to expand Kestra’s capabilities with new features and integrations, constantly **pushing the boundaries** of what’s possible.

## Built on the Power of Open Source

At the heart of Kestra’s success is our **global open-source community**. We empower engineers to easily adopt and integrate Kestra into their workflows by embracing open-source principles. This openness accelerates innovation, fosters collaboration, and ensures that Kestra is continuously improving based on **real-world needs**. It’s why thousands of production environments around the world depend on Kestra to power their **most critical workflows**.
