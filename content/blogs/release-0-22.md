Let's dive into these highlights and other enhancements in more detail.

## Feature Highlights

### Plugin Versioning

Managing plugin versions is critical for the stability of your orchestration platform. That's why we are excited to introduce Plugin Versioning in the Enterprise Edition.
Versioned Plugins allow you to simultaneously use multiple versions of plugins across your environment. This powerful capability allows teams to progressively adopt new features while pinning the plugin version for critical production workflows.

You can access that feature from the new dedicated UI page under Administration → Instance → Versioned Plugin, showing all available versions and making it easy to gradually upgrade your plugins when new versions are available.

To enable that capability, Kestra now stores plugins in internal storage and automatically synchronizes them across all workers, ensuring consistency throughout your environment. For organizations relying on custom plugins, we've added support for custom artifact registries.

### Read-Only Secrets Backends

Kestra 0.22 introduces Read-Only Secret backends, allowing you to use your existing secrets manager in a read-only mode without the ability to add or modify secrets in Kestra.

The read-only mode for secrets managers allows you to reference secrets entirely managed in an external system. This feature is particularly useful for customers with centralized secrets management in place who prefer to avoid managing secrets from the Kestra UI, e.g., for compliance reasons.

The UI clearly distinguishes externally managed secrets with a lock icon, providing visual confirmation of their read-only status. These secrets cannot be edited, created, or deleted through Kestra, ensuring your security policies remain enforced at the source.

### New flow-level property called `afterExecution`

This release introduces a new flow property called `afterExecution`, allowing you to run tasks **after** the execution of the flow e.g. to send different alerts depending on some condition. For instance, you can leverage this new property in combination with the `runIf` task property to send a different Slack message for successful and failed Executions — expand the example below to see it in action.

::collapse{title="Example Flow using the new property"}
```yaml
id: alerts_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello World!

  - id: fail
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail

afterExecution:
  - id: onSuccess
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'SUCCESS'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "{{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} finished successfully!"
      }

  - id: onFailure
    runIf: "{{execution.state == 'FAILED'}}"
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxx
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Oh no, {{flow.namespace}}.{{flow.id}} failed!!!"
      }
```
::

The `afterExecution` differs from the `finally` property because:
1. `finally` runs tasks at the end of the flow while the execution is still in a `RUNNING` state
2. `afterExecution` runs tasks after the Execution finishes in a terminal state like `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.

You might use `afterExecution` to send custom notifications after a flow completes, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Unlike `finally`, which runs while the execution is still in progress, `afterExecution` ensures these tasks only begin after the entire execution finishes.

</div>

### Sharing Namespace Files

Namespace files can now be shared and reused simply by referencing a given `namespace` directly in your script task. If you define multiple namespaces, Kestra will fetch the corresponding namespace files in the same order the namespaces are listed. If you have the same file(s) defined in multiple namespaces, the later namespaces will override files from earlier ones.


::collapse{title="Example of Namespace Files inheritance"}
```yaml
id: namespace_files_inheritance
namespace: company

tasks:
  - id: ns
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
      namespaces:
        - "company"
        - "company.team"
        - "company.team.myproject"
    commands:
      - python main.py
```
::

For detailed instructions on how to configure and use this feature, check the [Namespace Files documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/namespace-files).

### Sharing KV pairs across namespaces

We've introduced native inheritance for KV pairs so that the `kv('NAME')` function works the same way as `secret('NAME')` — first looking for the `NAME` key in the current namespace and then in the parent namespace if it's not found, then in the parent of the parent, and so on.

You can still provide a `namespace` explicitly as follows: `kv('KEY_NAME', namespace='NAMESPACE_NAME')`.

In the example below, the first task will be able to retrieve the key-value pair defined upstream in the `company` namespace (but not present in `company.team` namespace). The second task is able to get the key-value pair defined from another namespace explicitly provided in the `kv()` function.

For more details on how to use and configure the KV pairs, check our [KV Store documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/kv-store).

::collapse{title="Example of key-value inheritance"}
```yaml
id: key_value_inheritance
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: get_kv_from_parent
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ kv('my_key_from_company_namespace') }}"

  - id: get_kv_from_another_namespace
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ kv('test_value', namespace='test') }}"
```
::

### LDAP Integration

Enterprise environments require robust authentication and user management capabilities. Kestra 0.22 introduces LDAP integration to synchronize users, groups and authentication credentials from your existing LDAP directory.

Key features include:
- Automatic users and credentials sync from existing LDAP directories
- Group mapping for simplified RBAC
- Support for multiple LDAP servers
- Configurable attribute mapping for user profiles.

Once LDAP integration is set up, users logging into Kestra for the first time will have their credentials verified against the LDAP directory. Users belonging to groups defined in the directory will see those groups created in Kestra, or if a given group already exists in Kestra, LDAP users will be automatically added to it after login.

</div>

### New Log Shipper plugins

This release adds a new `AuditLogShipper` and new log exporter plugins to the Enterprise Edition, including:
- Splunk
- OpenSearch
- AWS S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage.

The cloud storage log exporters provide a cost-effective long-term storage solution for your logs.

Additionally, the new `AuditLogShipper` plugin allows you to export audit trails to multiple destinations, providing a convenient way to analyze comprehensive record of all user and service account actions within your Kestra instance.

For detailed information on setting up and configuring log shippers, check the [Log Shipper documentation](https://kestra.io/docs/enterprise/governance/logshipper).

### Unified Secrets and KV Store UI

This release introduces new global views for managing secrets and key-value pairs across your entire Kestra instance:

- **KV Store UI:** We've added a dedicated page listing all key-value pairs across all namespaces.
- **Secrets UI:** Enterprise Edition users gain a unified view of all Secrets existing in your instance across all namespaces, simplifying governance and bringing visibility about which secrets exist and within which namespaces they are managed.


## Notable Backend Enhancements

- We've revamped our **Queues** for performance and reliability. You can expect the `queues` database table to take up to 90% less database space due to aggresive cleaning and perform better. Queues can now sustain a much higher Executions throughput with lower database load. We also haven't forgotten about the Kafka runner, which also benefits from latency improvements due to configuration finetuning.
- [DevContainer support](docs/01.getting-started/03.contributing.md) simplifies development setup for contributors with ready-to-use environments
- [New Python package](https://github.com/kestra-io/libs/pull/16) allows you to read Kestra's native ION files into Pandas or Polars dataframes. Read more in our [Python How-to guide](/docs/how-to-guides/python)
- Improved Ansible integration with the ability to [capture outputs from individual steps](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-ansible/pull/35) of your Ansible playbooks
- Multiple bug fixes for dynamic properties ensure more reliable and predictable behavior across workflows
- Expanded context variables now include [taskrun and execution states accessible via Pebble](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/7155). The `{{tasks.your_task_id.state }}` context returns a task run's state while the `{{execution.state}}` allows to retrieve the flow execution state.

## UI Improvements

Here are UI enhancements worth noting:
- Improved Editor contrast in light mode
- New export functionality for topology views, allowing you to save workflow diagrams as PNG or JPG files for documentation or sharing with stakeholders
- Added one-click copy functionality for Pebble expressions (e.g., `{{kv('my_value')}}`) in KV Store and Secret tables for easier reference
- Improvements to flow filters in the UI (Filter flows by text, filter by multiple labels)
- As part of our continuous improvements to the No-Code Editor, we're releasing a Beta version of a Multi-Panel Editor. To enable this Beta feature, navigate to `Settings` and toggle the `Multi Panel Editor` on.

Our website performance has also significantly improved following Nuxt 2 to 3 migration, including a redesigned plugin page for easier navigation of plugin properties and outputs

## Plugin enhancements

### New GraalVM plugins (Beta)

We're pleased to introduce GraalVM integration to Kestra. GraalVM is a high-performance runtime that supports multiple programming languages, offering significant performance advantages through its advanced just-in-time compilation technology.

This integration enables in-memory execution of Python, JavaScript, and Ruby within Kestra workflows, eliminating the requirement for separate language installations or Docker images. The GraalVM plugin is currently in Beta, and we welcome your feedback on this exciting new feature.

::collapse{title="Example parsing JSON data using Python in GraalVM"}
```yaml
id: parse_json_data
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: http://xkcd.com/info.0.json

  - id: graal
    type: io.kestra.plugin.graalvm.python.Eval
    outputs:
      - data
    script: |
      data = {{ read(outputs.download.uri )}}
      data["next_month"] = int(data["month"]) + 1
```
::

### DuckDB & SQLite Improvements

This release resolves several issues and enhances persistence capabilities for operations involving DuckDB and SQLite databases.

The new `outputDbFile` boolean property enables both plugin tasks to fully support data persistence across your workflow tasks.

::collapse{title="Example with DuckDB"}
```yaml
id: duckdb_demo
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: write
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.storage.Write
    content: |
      field1,field2
      1,A
      2,A
      3,B

  - id: duckdb
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    inputFiles:
      data.csv: "{{ outputs.write.uri }}"
    sql: CREATE TABLE my_data AS (SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('data.csv'));
    outputDbFile: true

  - id: downstream
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    databaseUri: "{{ outputs.duckdb.databaseUri }}"
    sql: SELECT field2, SUM(field1) FROM my_data GROUP BY field2;
    fetchType: STORE
```
::

Also, it's now possible to avoid using `workingDir()` Pebble method in DuckDB to read local files.

::collapse{title="Reading file without using workingDir in DuckDB"}
```yaml
id: duckdb_no_working_dir
namespace: company.team

tasks:

  - id: download
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Download
    uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/raw/main/csv/orders.csv


  - id: query
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.duckdb.Query
    fetchType: STORE
    inputFiles:
      data.csv: "{{ outputs.download.uri }}"
    sql: SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('data.csv');
```
::


### New Snowflake CLI plugin

Developers can now streamline their Snowflake workflows using the new Snowflake CLI, enabling quick creation, management, and deployment of applications across Snowpark, Streamlit, native app frameworks and all the other possibilities offered by Snowflake. All of this with the automation power of Kestra!

::collapse{title="Snowflake CLI task example"}
```yaml
id: run_snowpark_function
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: snowflake_cli
    type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.snowflake.SnowflakeCLI
    commands:
      - snow --info
      - snow snowpark execute function "process_data()"

pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.jdbc.snowflake
    values:
      account: "{{secret('SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT')}}"
      username: "{{secret('SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME')}}"
      password: "{{secret('SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD')}}"
```
::

### New MariaDB tasks

We've also introduced a new plugin for MariaDB, including `Query`, `Queries` and `Trigger`, allowing you to interact with MariaDB databases directly from your Kestra workflows. Check out the [MariaDB plugin documentation](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-jdbc-mariadb) for more details.

### New ServiceNow plugins

We've expanded our ServiceNow integration with a new `Get` task and improvements to other ServiceNow plugins. This addition allows you to retrieve data from ServiceNow instances directly within your Kestra workflows. Check out the [ServiceNow plugin documentation](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-servicenow) to learn more.

### New Pebble functions

Kestra 0.22.0 introduces several new Pebble functions that enhance your workflow capabilities:

- **fileSize**: `{{ fileSize(outputs.download.uri) }}` — Returns the size of the file present at the given URI location.
- **fileExists**: `{{ fileExists(outputs.download.uri) }}` — Returns true if file is present at the given URI location.
- **fileEmpty**: `{{ isFileEmpty(outputs.download.uri) }}` — Returns true if file present at the given URI location is empty.
- **Environment Name**: `{{ kestra.environment.name }}` — Returns the name given to your environment. This value should be configured in the Kestra configuration.
- **Environment URL**: `{{ kestra.url }}` — Returns the environment's configured URL. This value should be configured in the Kestra configuration.
