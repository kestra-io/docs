YAML is a data serialization language known for its **human-readable format**. This format has been widely adopted in software development, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure.

YAML is extensively used in Kubernetes, Kustomize, GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, OpenAPI, AWS CloudFormation, Serverless Framework, GitLab CI, TravisCI, CircleCI, Ansible, Argo, Azure DevOps, and many more.

Kestra also relies on YAML for **defining flows declaratively** as well as for **configuring Kestra** itself.

Given the versatility and popularity of this configuration language, knowing how to work with YAML is a must-have skill for any engineering professional. This post provides a YAML crash course with practical Kestra flow examples.

## YAML Syntax Basics

The fundamental structure of YAML consists of **key-value pairs**, which can be **scalars** (_single values_), **lists**, or other **nested key-value pairs**.

YAML is **case-sensitive** and relies on **indentation** to structure data into hierarchies, either for **nested lists or maps** (dictionaries).

Here is a simple YAML example:

```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team
description: this is a simple Kestra flow
tasks:
  - this is a list of tasks
  - each list item is a map
  - with key-value pairs defining task properties
this_is_also_a_list: ["item1", "item2"]
you_can_mix_data_types: ["item1", 42, true, 4.2, null]
labels:
  this_is_a_map: of values
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
this_is_also_a_map: { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }
```

---

### Indentation

YAML uses Python-style indentation to structure key-value pairs into arbitrarily **nested hierarchies**.

The indentation is always **two spaces** rather than tabs for portability reasons. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid issues with different tab sizes on different systems. Therefore, **two whitespaces** (_literal `space` characters_) are used **instead of tabs** for indentation.

For example, the following YAML snippet defining which [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/namespace-files) should be included or excluded in a [Python script task](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-python/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.commands) has two levels of indentation — one for the `namespaceFiles` property and another for the `include` and `exclude` child properties:

```yaml
id: namespace_files
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: python_and_sql
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
      include:
        - "scripts/*.py"
        - "queries/*.sql"
      exclude:
        - "scripts/WIP.py"
    commands:
      - python scripts/etl.py
```

---

### Comments

YAML supports single-line comments initiated with `#`, which are ignored by the parser.

```yaml
# This is a comment in my flow
id: myflow
namespace: company.team
```

---

### Scalars and their Data Types

Scalars are single unquoted values which can represent various data types, including `string`, `timestamp`, `boolean`, `int`, or `float`, as well as `null` values. ISO-formatted date and datetime literals are parsed as `timestamp` data types. Scientific, hexadecimal, and octal notation formats are also natively supported in YAML.

Note how the example below deliberately uses both `camelCase` and `snake_case` formats to demonstrate that YAML supports both.

::alert{type="info"}
At Kestra, we follow the `camelCase` convention for all YAML properties. However, since YAML is case-sensitive, you can use both `camelCase` and `snake_case` formats in your configuration files.
::

```yaml
unquotedString: Rick Astley # simple scalar value
single_quoted_string: '123 Main Street, Apt. #42'
doubleQuotedStringKey: "123 Main Street, Apt. #42"

so_true: true # true, false, yes, no, on, off are valid boolean values
bugs_found: null # null is a special value in YAML

release_date: 2024-04-24 # YAML supports dates
release_datetime: 2024-04-24T12:00:00Z # ...and datetimes

scientific_nr: 1e+14 # evaluates to 100 trillion
hexadecimal_notation: 0xFF01  # evaluates to 65,281
octal_notation: 01234 # evaluates to 668 in decimal notation

# nested map
song:
  title: Never Gonna Give You Up
  artist: Rick Astley
  release_year: 1987 # integer value
  float_number: 4.2 # float value
```

---

### Boolean Values

YAML supports `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, and `off` as boolean values. In contrast to many programming languages, YAML does not interpret `1` or `0` as boolean values. If you use `1` or `0`, the YAML parser in Kestra will interpret both as `false`.

You can try it out using the following flow:

```yaml
id: boolean_test
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: mybool
    type: BOOLEAN
    defaults: yes # true, on

tasks:
  - id: true_or_false
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "{{ inputs.mybool }}"
```

---

### Explicit Data Types: valid, but not required in Kestra

YAML also supports explicit data type tags which follow the syntax `!![type] [value]`:

```yaml
tagged_string: !!str 0.5
tagged_boolean: !!bool true
tagged_null: !!null null
tagged_int: !!int 42
tagged_float: !!float -42.2
tagged_datetime: !!timestamp 2024-04-24T02:42:00+02:00
```

Since Kestra natively supports strongly typed inputs and task properties, **usually you don't need to use these data type tags**. However, if you use it, Kestra will correctly parse the value as the specified data type.

Here is an example you can use to validate how Kestra parses various data types:

```yaml
id: explicit_data_types
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: mybool
    type: BOOLEAN
    defaults: true

  - id: mybool_explicit
    type: BOOLEAN
    defaults: !!bool true

  - id: myint
    type: INT
    defaults: 42

  - id: myint_explicit
    type: INT
    defaults: !!int 42

  - id: myfloat
    type: FLOAT
    defaults: 42.2

  - id: myfloat_explicit
    type: FLOAT
    defaults: !!float 42.2

  - id: mystring
    type: STRING
    defaults: hello

  - id: mystring_explicit
    type: STRING
    defaults: !!str hello

  - id: mydatetime
    type: DATETIME
    defaults: 2024-04-24T02:42:00+02:00

  - id: mydatetime_explicit
    type: DATETIME
    defaults: !!timestamp 2024-04-24T02:42:00+02:00

tasks:
  - id: print_values
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: |
      mybool: {{ inputs.mybool }}
      mybool_explicit: {{ inputs.mybool_explicit }}
      myint: {{ inputs.myint }}
      myint_explicit: {{ inputs.myint_explicit }}
      myfloat: {{ inputs.myfloat }}
      myfloat_explicit: {{ inputs.myfloat_explicit }}
      mystring: {{ inputs.mystring }}
      mystring_explicit: {{ inputs.mystring_explicit }}
      mydatetime: {{ inputs.mydatetime }}
      mydatetime_explicit: {{ inputs.mydatetime_explicit }}
```

The image below shows how you can overwrite various input values before starting an Execution. This is extremely useful for experimenting with different values.

## Handling Strings

Strings in YAML don't need to be quoted unless they contain special characters like spaces in keys or colons in values. For example, the following YAML snippet is valid:

```yaml
simple_key: simple value
quoted_value: "namespace: company.team" # string with a colon has to be quoted
"quoted key": the key contains a space so it has to be quoted
```

In practice, you'll rarely see quoted keys — most applications standardize on either the `camelCase` or `snake_case` convention without allowing special characters in keys. However, **if your key requires a space** or a special character, you need to **quote it**.

::alert{type="info"}
Kestra doesn't use spaces or special characters in keys. Instead, we follow the `camelCase` convention without spaces or special characters in keys.
::

String values can contain spaces, but special characters, incl. `:`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `!`, `|`, `>`, `'`, `"`, `%`, `@`, `` ` `` are reserved and must be quoted.

::alert{type="info"}
Usually, scalar values are parsed by YAML into the matching `int`, `float`, `string`, `timestamp`, `null`, or `boolean` data types. If you put those in **quotes**, they will be parsed as `strings` instead:

```yaml
string_value_with_int_nr: "42"
int_value: 42

string_value_with_float_nr: "42.2"
float_value: 42.2

string_value_with_boolean: "true"
boolean_value: true
```
::

### Multi-line Strings

You can use `|` for a literal block, where **line breaks are preserved**, or `>` for a folded block, where each newline is replaced with a single space.

Typically, `|` is **used in most scenarios in Kestra**, as it preserves the original structure of a string block, incl. line breaks and indentation.

```yaml
literal: |
  line1
  line2
folded: >
  line1
  line2
```

---

### The Trailing Newline in Multi-line Strings

When using `|` or `>` for multi-line strings, you can choose **whether to keep the trailing newline or not**. In YAML, `|-`, `|+`, `>-`, and `>+` are used to provide an explicit indication of how to handle trailing newlines in multi-line strings.

Here are the differences:

1. **`|-`** is used to preserve newline characters except for the final one. The final newline character is stripped. The example below results in the string `"first line\nsecond line"`, with **no trailing newline**.

   ```yaml
   multi_line: |-
     first line
     second line
   ```

2. **`|+`** is  similar to `|-`, but it keeps the final newline. The example below results in the string `"first line\nsecond line\n"`, **preserving the trailing newline**.

   ```yaml
   multi_line: |+
     first line
     second line
   ```


3. With **`>-`**, newlines become spaces unless there are two or more consecutive newlines, in which case one is kept. This results in `"first line second line\nnew paragraph"`, with **no trailing newline** after "new paragraph".

   ```yaml
   folded: >-
     first line
     second line

     new paragraph
   ```



4. **`>+`** is similar to `>-`, but it keeps the final newline. This will return `"first line second line\nnew paragraph\n"`, **including the trailing newline**.

   ```yaml
   folded: >+
     first line
     second line

     new paragraph
   ```



::alert{type="info"}
To sum up multi-line strings, the `|` character preserves newlines as they are, and `>` is for folded blocks converting newlines to spaces. The `+` keeps the trailing newline, while `-` removes it.
::

## ⚡️ Using YAML in Kestra Flows

You can apply what you've learned about YAML to define `tasks`, `inputs`, `labels`, `pluginDefaults`, `triggers`, and the flow structure of a Kestra workflow.

Here is a flow example combining everything you've learned so far:

```yaml
id: getting_started
namespace: company.team

description: >
  This flow has two tasks: one prints a message,
  and the other makes an HTTP request.
  This description property is a folded multi-line string.

# example of a map i.e. nested key-value pairs
labels:
  owner: rick.astley
  project: never-gonna-give-you-up

# example of a list of maps
inputs:
  - id: user
    type: STRING
    defaults: Rick Astley

  - id: api_url
    type: STRING
    defaults: https://dummyjson.com/products

tasks:
  - id: print_inputs
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    runner: PROCESS
    commands:
      - echo "Hey there, {{ inputs.user }} from flow {{ flow.id }}!"
    description: |
      ## Multi-line string example to add a markdown description
      which will preserve line breaks and indentation.

      This task will greet a `user` from a flow.

  - id: api
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: "{{ inputs.api_url }}"

pluginDefaults:
  - type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    values:
      env:
        ENV_VARIABLE: variable needed in all Shell tasks
      docker:
        image: ubuntu:latest # image for all Shell tasks

triggers:
  - id: hourly_schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    disabled: true # boolean to temporarily disable the schedule
    cron: "@hourly" # special character @ requires using quotes
```

In this example:
- The flow has a unique `id` within a `namespace`. Both are simple **scalar** values.
- The `labels` are optional and can be used to add metadata to the flow, which is useful to filter executions. Note how the `labels` are defined as a **map** with `key: value` pairs.
- The `inputs` is a **list of strongly-typed variables** that can be used in the flow. Each input has a `name`, `type`, and `defaults` child properties.
- The `tasks` property is a **list of tasks**, each with its `id` and `type`. The tasks will be executed in the order they are defined in the list.
- The first task prints a `message` with a template variable `{{ inputs.user }}` and has a **multi-line** `description` property for an arbitrarily long markdown description to document the task.
- The second task makes an HTTP request to the `api_url` defined in the `inputs`.
- The `pluginDefaults` property is a **list of default values** for all tasks of a specific type. In this example, all `Shell` tasks will have the same `env` and `docker` properties to avoid repeating them in each task.
- The `triggers` property is a **list of triggers** that can be used to automatically start the flow. In this example, the flow has a `Schedule` trigger that runs the flow every hour. The `disabled` **boolean** property is used to temporarily disable the trigger.

## YAML Best Practices

When writing YAML, especially for complex Kestra workflows, make sure to follow best practices mentioned below for **readability** and **maintainability**.

First, ensure **consistent indentation**. Remember that **two spaces** are used for indentation rather than tabs.

Next, use **comments** sparingly. Comments can clarify the purpose of various sections or tasks, but when they are overused, the flow may become less readable. Consider using the `description` property to add a markdown description to your Kestra flows, tasks or triggers. This is a better alternative to comments because it allows **multi-line markdown strings**, which are **rendered in the UI**.

Finally, **validate YAML syntax** before using it in production. This will help you catch syntax errors and avoid runtime issues. Kestra ⚡️ **automatically performs syntax validation** ⚡️ when you use the built-in editor or Kestra's VS Code extension. Kestra **highlights syntax errors** live as you type, and displays **warnings** when using deprecated properties.
