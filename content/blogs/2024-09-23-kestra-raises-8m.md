A year ago we were announcing a $3 Million pre-seed and working hard to unify orchestration for all engineers. Fasttrack to today, and Kestra‚Äôs usage has grown 10x since then. Our momentum is stronger than ever, and today‚Äôs $8 Million seed round is going to propel us even further. This blog post covers Kestra‚Äôs unique achievements in building an open-source Unified Orchestration platform, and how it is gaining the trust and respect of the entire tech community.


## Kestra is backed by leading tech founders and CEOs

This $8 Million seed round brings together numerous tech founders and CEOs: Tristan Handy (dbt Labs); Michel Tricot (Airbyte); Olivier Pomel (Datadog); Clement Delangue (Hugging Face); Bertrand Diard (Talend); Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia); and Fr√©d√©ric Plais (Platform.sh). The round itself is led by Alven, alongside ISAI and Axeleo Capital. All of them are convinced that, even though Kestra is already the fastest growing open-source orchestration product, the future is even greater than that. Kestra‚Äôs mission is to simplify and unify orchestration for all engineers globally, and this round of funding will help us further accelerate our product‚Äôs growth in that direction.

Our focus at Kestra is always on product first. In fact if you‚Äôre curious about how we‚Äôve got investors on board, you can discover our public seed deck here: [Kestra‚Äôs seed round pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_qp8h5B05r3yGJb2zQVU4v0ce1rWeA1BSCb7aYslt8/edit#slide=id.g300ffa71050_0_0) . It is about our product vision, our product growth and the massive opportunity we are seeing in front of us.


## We offer a One-Stop Solution for Orchestration


We believe all engineers can benefit from automation. Not just data engineers or software engineers, but the entire tech community of users involved in infrastructure, analytics, business processes, and more. At Kestra we think use-cases for orchestration are nearly infinite. Unfortunately, though the current orchestration landscape is crowded with products that each cater to one specific segment and struggle to expand beyond their initial niche. This is why we‚Äôve built Kestra as a universal product from day one, to help orchestrate across all functions, across all lines of business. This is why we‚Äôre open-source too!

Our platform is built from the ground up to be language- and cloud-agnostic, extensible, and accessible to all. We refuse to be restricted to one specific use case, and we instead continuously add features and integrations that can solve any orchestration use case. Data orchestration, process automation, infrastructure builds and more; they all play nicely with Kestra. Our open-source success as well as our commercial growth proves that we are on the right path, and already today Kestra is powering mission-critical workflows for thousands of production environments. It enables use-cases ranging from infrastructure automation, to data ingestion and transformation, or even real time network monitoring.

‚ÄúKestra has been a keystone to design complex execution flows while enhancing our Infrastructure as Code best practices.‚Äù

## Hundreds of Millions of Workflows Executed... And Counting!

Thousands of new Kestra instances are being deployed every month, **and [our open-source community](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) has grown 10x since the pre-seed fundraising announcement**. Users are coming from all fronts: DevOps, analysts, software engineers, IT management, automation enthusiasts, and more. Kestra helps them get workflows up-and-running in less than 5 minutes, notably thanks to:

- **Declarative definition of workflows**: they can be built in the UI or as-code (be it in our built-in editor or in a separate IDE).
- **Integrations with over 500+ tools**: via an open plugin library (interacting with products like Databricks, Snowflake, dbt, Airbyte, Salesforce, and much more).
- **Support for all clouds or on-prem environments**: from a simple Docker run command to more complex deployments across AWS, GCP or Azure.

Thousands of organizations now trust Kestra and orchestrate hundreds millions of mission-critical workflows globally.

‚ÄúKestra is the unifying layer for our data and workflows. You can start small, but then there is no limit to the possibilities and scalability of such an open architecture.‚Äù

## Scaling up to Mission-Critical Workflows in production

The last year has also demonstrated Kestra‚Äôs success not just with individual teams of engineers, but with enterprises overall. Kestra offers a single orchestration stack, on which multiple teams can be onboarded (data, infrastructure, business process management, microservices and more) and share best practices. The business overall benefits:
- **Reduced operational costs**: fewer tools and contracts to manage
- **Simpler infrastructure**: One centralized solution for all orchestration and automation use cases
- **Higher productivity**: Kestra‚Äôs lower barrier to entry helps rapidly onboard new users, and apply best practices across the organization.

And engineering teams benefit as well:
- **Unlimited scaling capacity**: thank to reliable remote execution through dynamic cloud compute
- **Top-tier reliability and availability**: thanks to high-availability clusters, retry strategies and built-in resilience
- **Integration with existing tech stack**: Kestra supports 3rd-party secrets managers, audit trailing, and the usual SSO/RBAC

Some of the most innovative companies have chosen Kestra as their Unified Orchestration platform, and teams use it to power mission-critical workflows at scale.

## A look at what‚Äôs ahead
2024 has brought significant new features to Kestra users and automation enthusiasts: Real-Time Triggers, remote Task Runners to handle heavy tasks via on-demand compute, a built-in Key-Value Store and more. This funding round will fuel our engineering growth and accelerate our feature delivery.
We are refining Kestra‚Äôs onboarding so that any user can build its first workflow within 5 minutes, no matter its experience level. Additional third-party integrations and simplified plugin management are also in progress. As for teams operating at enterprise level, we‚Äôre advancing towards SOC-2 compliance and are bringing more reporting and monitoring capabilities.

A new Kestra version is available every 8 weeks, and we are continuously listening to your feedback, ideas, and contributions. The best way to get a feel of our most recent functionality is to try it out, so we invite you to hop on and [get started with Kestra](https://kestra.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart#start-kestra).

Once more, we thank the entire community of users, customers, and investors who are supporting us on this incredible adventure. Your support propels us to remain the fastest-growing open-source orchestrator. You can star us on GitHub if you wish to be part of our journey, or simply stay connected to us as we continue building the go-to Unified Orchestration platform.
