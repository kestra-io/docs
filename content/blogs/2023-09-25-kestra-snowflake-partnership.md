We're excited to announce that we are now registered partners with Snowflake, one of the most trusted names in cloud data warehousing. This strategic alliance between [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) aims to empower organizations to seamlessly manage, orchestrate, and optimize their workflows.

## Why This Partnership Matters

Snowflake has set a high standard for cloud-based data warehousing, offering a robust platform that handles structured and semi-structured data with ease. Kestra, on the other hand, brings its expertise in orchestrating all kinds of workflows, providing an essential layer of automation and control. Together, the synergy between Kestra and Snowflake offers a comprehensive solution for data management that is both efficient and reliable.

### Event-driven triggers for Snowflake

initiate workflows based on real-time changes in your Snowflake data. Kestra's event-driven triggers make this possible, offering a dynamic way to manage your data pipelines.

### File Management Simplified

With Kestra, you can easily manage your files within Snowflake. Whether it's downloading data to an internal Kestra stage or uploading it to Snowflake, Kestra streamlines these processes.

### Querying Made Easy

Kestra's [Snowflake plugin](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-jdbc-snowflake) allows you to perform a variety of SQL queries, from simple fetch operations to complex transactions, all within the same workflow. This level of flexibility is invaluable for developer teams looking to optimize their pipelines.

## Build Snowflake Data Pipelines with Kestra

Kestra's Snowflake plugin makes data warehousing simple even for non-developers thanks to YAML. Your Snowflake storage pipeline can accommodate raw data from multiple sources and transform it using ETL operations. Additionally, you can skip the transformation and directly load data into the warehouse using the ELT pipeline. Kestra can manage both workflows simultaneously. In any case, Kestra ensures that the data is readily available to perform analysis and learn valuable patterns.

## A Partnership with a Forward-Looking Vision

The collaboration between Kestra and Snowflake is not just a one-off event; it's the beginning of a strategic partnership designed to evolve. Both companies are committed to exploring new synergies that will bring even more robust and integrated solutions to the market. This is just the first step, and as we move forward, customers can expect to see additional features and enhanced capabilities that will further optimize their data management experience.
