</div>


Let's dive into these highlights and other enhancements in more detail.


## Localization UI

Kestra now supports **12 different languages** — you can easily switch from English to your preferred language directly from the [Settings](https://kestra.io/docs/ui/settings) page. This makes the platform more accessible and user-friendly for teams across the globe, letting you work in the language you feel most comfortable with.

Here’s the full list of the currently supported languages:
- 🇺🇸 English (en)
- 🇩🇪 German (de)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (es)
- 🇫🇷 French (fr)
- 🇮🇳 Hindi (hi)
- 🇮🇹 Italian (it)
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (ja)
- 🇰🇷 Korean (ko)
- 🇵🇱 Polish (pl)
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese (pt)
- 🇷🇺 Russian (ru)
- 🇨🇳 Chinese (zh_CN)

With this new localization feature, Kestra is now language-agnostic both in terms of programming languages and spoken languages. If the language you speak isn’t on the list, let us know, and we’ll do our best to add it. We also encourage you to [contribute to the translation](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/tree/develop/ui/src/translations) of Kestra into your language or submit a pull request with a fix to any translation issues you might find.

## The New Dashboard

At Kestra, we know how critical it is to have a clear view of your orchestration platform's health. We’ve redesigned the main dashboard to offer a more refined, focused experience, showing the information you need without overwhelming you with unnecessary details.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYu6_6Bj7hs?si=V-KtcXywLY7cle_C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The previous dashboard aimed to display as much information as possible, but over time, it became cluttered and sometimes slow to load (see the image below).

![old_vs_new_dashboard](/blogs/release-0-19/old_vs_new_dashboard.png)

Here’s what we’ve changed:

- **Simplified Visuals**: The new dashboard replaces the previous donut charts with clear KPI numbers, instantly showing success and failure ratios.

- **Improved Color Scheme**: To make the Dashboard more accessible, we’ve added a color-blind-friendly palette (scroll down to the image below) alongside the default classic red-green view. You can switch between the two color schemes in the Settings menu — choose either `Classic` (red-green) or `Kestra` (purple-pink).

- **Performance**: We’ve removed redundant tables to ensure faster load times. The new Dashboard gives you an instant overview of the health of your platform, including information about currently running and the next scheduled executions.

This new layout brings clarity and faster load times, and is visually appealing! See the screenshot below.

![new_dashboard_purple](/blogs/release-0-19/new_dashboard_purple.png)

In the future, we plan to add more customization options allowing you to set custom color palettes and create additional visuals.

## System Flows

System Flows are designed to handle periodically executed background operations that keep your platform running but are generally kept out of sight. These flows automate maintenance workflows, such as:
1. Sending [alert notifications](https://kestra.io/blueprints/system/250-set-up-alerts-for-failed-workflow-executions-using-slack)
2. Creating automated support tickets when critical workflows fail
3. [Purging logs](https://kestra.io/blueprints/trigger/234-purge-execution-data-including-logs-metrics-and-outputs-on-a-schedule) and removing old executions or internal storage files to save space
4. Syncing code from Git or pushing code to Git
5. Automatically [releasing flows](https://kestra.io/blueprints/system/258-copy-flows-from-development-to-qa-and-staging-environments-or-tenants) from development to QA and staging environments.

We refer to these as **System Flows** because, by default, they are hidden from end users and only visible within the `system` namespace. This way, you can automate maintenance tasks without cluttering the UI for regular users. If you prefer, you can use a different namespace name instead of `system` by overwriting the following [configuration](https://kestra.io/docs/configuration-guide/system-flows):

```yaml
kestra:
  system-flows:
    namespace: system
```

To access System Flows, navigate to the `Namespaces` section in the UI. The `system` namespace is pinned at the top for quick access.

![system_namespace](/blogs/release-0-19/system_namespace.png)

Here, you’ll find the _System Blueprints_ tab, which provides fully customizable templates tagged for system use. You can modify these templates to suit your organization’s needs.

![system_blueprints](/blogs/release-0-19/system_blueprints.png)

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8OhRFGCV3A?si=jw-VsFDdVutDObhL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

::alert{type="info"}
Keep in mind that System Flows are not restricted to System Blueprints — any valid Kestra flow can become a System Flow if it's added to the `system` namespace.
::

System Flows are intentionally hidden from the main UI, appearing only in the `system` namespace. The Dashboard, Flows, and Executions pages now offer a multi-select filter with options for `User` (default) and `System` (visible by default only within the `system` namespace). This makes it easy to toggle between user-facing workflows and background system flows and their executions, or view both simultaneously.

![system_filter](/blogs/release-0-19/system_filter.png)

In terms of permissions, the `system` namespace is open by default. With the namespace-level RBAC functionality in the Enterprise Edition, you can restrict access to the `system` namespace only to Admins, while assigning `company.*` namespaces to your general user base.

The video below demonstrates how to set up System Flows:

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o05hcKNI_7I?si=fo8XuY6yVTmUTykb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

---


## Conditional Inputs

You can now define inputs based on conditions, allowing one input to depend on another. This feature enables interactive workflows that adapt to prior user inputs, including approval workflows, dynamic resource provisioning, and many more.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTP6t4QcUUY?si=gN_YlZtjmMXOltMu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

To see it in action, first add the necessary JSON key-value pairs that will be used as selectable values in the conditional inputs:

```yaml
id: add_kv_pairs
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: access_permissions
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON # 👈 New property
    value: |
      ["Admin", "Developer", "Editor", "Launcher", "Viewer"]
```

::collapse{title="Expand for a full workflow setting up all key-value pairs"}
```yaml
id: add_kv_pairs
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: access_permissions
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON
    value: |
      ["Admin", "Developer", "Editor", "Launcher", "Viewer"]

  - id: saas_applications
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON
    value: |
      ["Slack", "Notion", "HubSpot", "GitHub", "Jira"]

  - id: development_tools
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON
    value: |
      ["Cursor", "IntelliJ IDEA", "PyCharm Professional", "Datagrip"]

  - id: cloud_vms
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON
    value: |
      {
        "AWS": ["t2.micro", "t2.small", "t2.medium", "t2.large"],
        "GCP": ["f1-micro", "g1-small", "n1-standard-1", "n1-standard-2"],
        "Azure": ["Standard_B1s", "Standard_B1ms", "Standard_B2s", "Standard_B2ms"]
      }

  - id: cloud_regions
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set
    key: "{{ task.id }}"
    kvType: JSON
    value: |
      {
        "AWS": ["us-east-1", "us-west-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"],
        "GCP": ["us-central1", "us-east1", "us-west1", "europe-west1"],
        "Azure": ["eastus", "westus", "centralus", "northcentralus"]
      }
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
Did you notice the new `kvType` property in the `io.kestra.plugin.core.kv.Set` task? [This new property](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/commit/379f3b34e3139e010bf8aa03b9494190255cc2a2) allows you to specify the type of the key-value pair, which is an Enum that can be set to one of the following: `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `DURATION`, `JSON`, `NUMBER`, `STRING`. Storing strongly typed KV pairs like JSON objects or arrays allows you to dynamically retrieve those as `SELECT` or `MULTISELECT` values in your conditional inputs.
::


We can now create a flow with conditional inputs that will reference the key-value pairs we've just configured:

```yaml
id: request_resources
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: resource_type
    displayName: Resource Type # 👈 New property allowing to set a friendly name
    type: SELECT
    required: true
    values:
      - Access permissions
      - SaaS application
      - Development tool
      - Cloud VM

  - id: access_permissions
    displayName: Access Permissions
    type: SELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('access_permissions') }}"
    allowCustomValue: true
    dependsOn: # 👈 New property enabling conditional inputs
      inputs:
        - resource_type
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Access permissions' }}"

    # 👇 Expand the field below for a full example
```


::collapse{title="Full workflow example using the new Conditional Inputs feature"}

```yaml
id: request_resources
namespace: company.team

inputs:
  - id: resource_type
    displayName: Resource Type
    type: SELECT
    required: true
    values:
      - Access permissions
      - SaaS application
      - Development tool
      - Cloud VM

  - id: access_permissions
    displayName: Access Permissions
    type: SELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('access_permissions') }}"
    allowCustomValue: true
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Access permissions' }}"

  - id: saas_applications
    displayName: SaaS Application
    type: MULTISELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('saas_applications') }}"
    allowCustomValue: true
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'SaaS application' }}"

  - id: development_tools
    displayName: Development Tool
    type: SELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('development_tools') }}"
    allowCustomValue: true
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Development tool' }}"

  - id: cloud_provider
    displayName: Cloud Provider
    type: SELECT
    values:
      - AWS
      - GCP
      - Azure
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Cloud VM' }}"

  - id: cloud_vms
    displayName: Cloud VM
    type: SELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('cloud_vms')[inputs.cloud_provider] }}"
    allowCustomValue: true
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
        - cloud_provider
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Cloud VM' }}"

  - id: region
    displayName: Cloud Region
    type: SELECT
    expression: "{{ kv('cloud_regions')[inputs.cloud_provider] }}"
    dependsOn:
      inputs:
        - resource_type
        - cloud_provider
        - cloud_vms
      condition: "{{ inputs.resource_type equals 'Cloud VM' }}"

variables:
  slack_message: |
    Validate resource request.
    To approve the request, click on the Resume button here
    http://localhost:28080/ui/executions/{{flow.namespace}}/{{flow.id}}/{{execution.id}}.

tasks:
  - id: send_approval_request
    type: io.kestra.plugin.notifications.slack.SlackIncomingWebhook
    url: https://reqres.in/api/slack
    payload: |
      {
        "channel": "#devops",
        "text": {{ render(vars.slack_message) | json }}
      }

  - id: wait_for_approval
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Pause
    onResume:
      - id: approved
        description: Whether to approve the request
        type: BOOLEAN
        defaults: true

      - id: comment
        description: Extra comments about the provisioned resources
        type: STRING
        defaults: All requested resources are approved

  - id: approve
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
    uri: https://reqres.in/api/resources
    method: POST
    contentType: application/json
    body: "{{ inputs }}"

  - id: log
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: |
      Status of the request {{ outputs.wait_for_approval.onResume.comment }}.
      Process finished with {{ outputs.approve.body }}.
```
::

The above flow demonstrates how the `dependsOn` property allows you to set up a chain of dependencies, where one input depends on other inputs or conditions. In this example, the `access_permissions`, `saas_applications`, `development_tools`, and `cloud_vms` inputs are conditionally displayed based on the `resource_type` input value.

Conditional inputs enable interactive workflows that adapt to prior user inputs, incl. approval workflows, dynamic resource provisioning, and many more.

You might also notice a new `allowCustomValue` [boolean property](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4496) that, if set to `true`, allows users to enter custom values when the predefined ones don't fit their needs. This enables you to provide a list of default values but still (optionally) allow users to enter custom ones.

A [final addition](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4126) to the input types is the new `YAML` type, which allows users to input YAML-formatted data directly in the UI. This new type is especially handy when you orchestrate applications that require YAML input such as Kubernetes manifests or configuration files.

## New Log Level Display

For each Kestra execution, you can filter logs by specific levels, such as WARN or ERROR. However, this alone doesn't give you the full context needed for troubleshooting. For instance, seeing only a WARN-level log in isolation, without the surrounding logs (before and after), may not provide the full picture to trace the root cause of an issue.

Kestra 0.19.0 makes logs view [context-aware](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2045) — you can see all log levels while still being able to jump directly to the next `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` logs.

![loglevel_display](blogs/release-0-19/loglevel_display.png)

Using the new log-level navigation, you can quickly jump to the next log of a specific level while having the full context at your fingertips. With that additional context, it's easier to understand what led up to an issue and what followed, simplifying troubleshooting.

See the video below for a quick demo of the new feature:

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Yz0N_26lDY?si=Vyy5ETE384wHflaK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

**Additional log enhancements worth mentioning**:
- Logs tab is [now faster](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2188) and will no longer freeze the UI page even with a large number of task runs.
- You can now [log to a file](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4688) in the internal storage using a new `logToFile` core property available on all tasks. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that produce a large amount of logs that would otherwise take up too much space in the database. The same property can be set on triggers.
- [We've added](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2451) a dedicated [Python logger](https://github.com/kestra-io/libs/blob/main/python/src/kestra.py#L60)  to ensure that all logs emitted by a Python script are [captured](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/commit/c58e42ef0dd589af86ae6597bc87c03737c0d913) with the right log levels. Check the [Python Script task](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-python/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.script) plugin documentation for more details and examples.

## In-app Versioning for Docs and Blueprints

We’re thrilled to introduce versioned docs and blueprints built directly into the UI. This change addresses one of the biggest pain points users have faced: the lack of version-specific documentation and examples.

Until now, the documentation and blueprints were served on the website for the latest version of Kestra. As a result, if you were on an older version, some documentation and blueprints might have been overwritten by a new syntax or showing functionality that wasn’t available in your version.

From v0.19.0 on, Kestra dynamically fetches the correct documentation and blueprints based on the Kestra version you’re using. This is handled through new API endpoints pulling the relevant content when needed.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that the documentation you see on the website always reflects the `latest` stable release. However, when you’re working in the app, you’ll see documentation and blueprint examples for your Kestra version. We deliberately decided not to introduce versioning on the website for now to avoid confusion when you accidentally stumble upon docs for an older version, which often results in broken links and annoying banners constantly reminding you to switch to the _latest_ version when browsing the documentation for an _older_ version.
::

Overall, we believe that **the best documentation is the one you don't have to read**. The second best is one that is always up-to-date and relevant to your current environment, and resurfaced when you need it. With this new feature, we aim to serve you the right documentation at the right time, making it easier to understand and use Kestra.

In the future, we plan to display the documentation pages next to the UI elements they describe. For example, you'll be able to easily access the documentation for KV Store right when you access the KV Store UI tab.

## Enterprise Edition Enhancements

### Refresh Token and Encryption Key ⚠️

With the release of Kestra 0.19.0, there’s an important change you should be aware of before upgrading. To support enhanced security features like authentication, backup & restore, and JWT signatures for refresh tokens, you'll **need to set an encryption key** in your Kestra configuration.

This configuration step is critical to ensure that Kestra EE operates correctly after the upgrade. If you're already using `SECRET`-type inputs, your encryption key should be in place, but if not, here's what you need to add to your `application.yaml`:

```yaml
kestra:
  encryption:
    secret-key: pleaseChangeThisSecret # ✅ mandatory!
```

The key needs to be at least 32 ASCII characters long (256 bits), so don’t forget to replace `pleaseChangeThisSecret` with a secure, custom value. While this key never expires, the refresh token it signs is valid for 30 days, similar to a JWT token with a default 1-hour lifetime.

If you want to use a separate secret for your JWT refresh token signature, you can **optionally** customize that as follows:

```yaml
micronaut:
  security:
    token:
      jwt:
        signatures:
          secret:
            generator:
              secret: "${JWT_GENERATOR_SIGNATURE_SECRET:pleaseChangeThisSecret}" # ✅ optional
```

In case you ever need to revoke a refresh token, it's easy to do with a simple `DELETE` request to `/users/{id}/refresh-token` — this can be useful in emergency situations, e.g., when you suspect your computer has been compromised.

As always, if you have any questions or run into issues during the upgrade, our support team is here to help — just reach out via the Customer Portal or through your dedicated Slack channel.


### Keeping You Logged In

The above mentioned breaking change addresses an issue where users were logged out due to session timeouts, even while they were still active. Previously, Kestra would log users out based on a fixed interval (for security reasons). If this happened during flow editing, it could result in unsaved changes and an unexpected logout.

With the [new mechanism](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4120) introduced in this release, Kestra now automatically refreshes your auth token or session cookie if you're still active. If the token is close to expiring, Kestra silently refreshes it in the background. This small but critical change ensures your session stays alive while you're working, without any interruptions.


### Backup & Restore of Metadata

Starting from version 0.19.0, Kestra [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise) introduces the ability to back up and restore metadata, making it easy to safeguard everything you've configured in the platform and move that configuration across different environments. Whether you're migrating to another Kestra version or switching backends, this feature provides flexibility and peace of mind. By default, all backups are encrypted using Kestra’s built-in encryption key.

To back up your Kestra instance, simply run the following command:

```shell
kestra backups create FULL # or TENANT
```

Restoring your instance is just as straightforward. Use the URI generated during the backup process to restore metadata with this command:

```shell
kestra backups restore kestra:///backups/full/backup-20241001163000.kestra
```

When the restore process completes, Kestra provides a detailed summary, showing the number of items restored, ensuring you have full visibility into the process. Read more about the [Backup & Restore feature](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/backup-and-restore) in our documentation.

### Worker Groups UI Page and Validation

Enterprise Edition introduces a dedicated `Worker Groups` UI page. This feature ensures that worker groups are created before being used in flows, preventing runtime issues caused by a misconfigured `workerGroup.key` property.

Using an invalid worker group key in a task leads to task runs being stuck in a `CREATED` state. Some users experienced this when they mistakenly set an incorrect worker group key. Until now, there was no early detection of the problem while writing the flow, which only surfaced at runtime.

With the new Worker Groups UI page, worker groups are now treated as API-first objects — they must be created first from the UI, API, CLI, or Terraform before being used in flows. This ensures that worker group keys are valid and exist before they are referenced in tasks.

Check the [Worker Group](https://kestra.io/docs/enterprise/worker-group) documentation to learn how to create and manage worker groups.

In short, [this new feature](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/1525) improves the way worker groups are managed, reducing the risk of misconfigured flows and providing better visibility into workers' health.


### Managed Roles

This release also adds **Managed Roles**, a set of read-only roles that are fully managed by Kestra. These roles — **`Admin`, `Editor`, `Launcher`, `Developer`, and `Viewer`** — are designed to simplify permission management, ensuring that users automatically receive the necessary permissions for new features without manual updates.

**How Managed Roles Work**: Managed Roles cannot be edited or customized. When users attempt to add or remove permissions from these roles, a friendly error message will appear: _"Managed roles are read-only. Create a custom role if you need fine-grained permissions."_

One of the key advantages of Managed Roles is that they stay up to date automatically. When Kestra adds new features, such as **KV Store**, users with Managed Roles (like `Admins`) will automatically have the appropriate permissions to access these new capabilities. This removes the need for admins to manually update permissions for each new feature.

If more granular control is needed, you can still create **custom roles** tailored to specific requirements. For most users, [Managed Roles](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/1327) provide a convenient, hands-off approach to role and permission management, ensuring access to all new features without any extra work.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that Managed Roles are not the same as [Default Roles](https://kestra.io/docs/configuration-guide/enterprise-edition#default-role-from-configuration). A default role is a role that will be assigned by default to every new user joining your instance, which is useful for users automatically created via SSO. Managed Roles, on the other hand, are predefined roles that cannot be edited or customized. You can assign a Managed Role as a Default Role. In this release, we've [enhanced](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/1344) the Default Role configuration to include an optional `tenantId` allowing you to restrict the default role access only to a specific tenant when needed (e.g., development, staging, production).

### New Permissions View

The previous permissions dropdown was a bit tedious, requiring you to manually select each permission and its corresponding actions in order to configure a role.

Kestra 0.19 [introduces](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/874) a more convenient **view for permissions management** to simplify selecting the required permissions without having to manually click through every dropdown element. This new view allows you to:
- Check a parent element, such as `FLOWS`
- Automatically select all associated actions (`CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

In short, the new permissions view eliminates tedious clicks needed to configure roles.

![permissions_tree_view](/blogs/release-0-19/permissions_tree_view.png)

---

### Forgot Password Functionality

This release also [adds](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/603) a Password Reset functionality to the Enterprise Edition, allowing users to get an email link to reset a password directly from the login page.


Note that you'll only see the "Forgot password" option if the email server is configured on your instance.

Here’s how you can configure the email server in your `application.yaml` file:

```yaml
kestra:
  mail-service:
    host: String
    port: Number
    username: String
    password: String
    from: String
    starttlsEnable: Boolean
    auth: String
```

On the User detail page, users with basic authentication and an email set have the option to reset their password.

![reset_password](/blogs/release-0-19/reset_password.png)

### Purging Old Audit Logs

The Enterprise Edition of Kestra generates an audit log for every action taken on the platform. While these logs are essential for tracking changes and ensuring compliance, they can accumulate over time and take up significant space in the database.

We’ve added a new task called `PurgeAuditLogs`, which helps you manage the growing number of audit logs by removing those that are no longer needed.

You can set a date range for the logs you want to delete, choose a specific `namespace`, and even filter by `permissions` or `actions` (like `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). This task gives you a simple way to implement an Audit Logs retention policy that fits your organization's needs.

For example, to purge logs older than one month, you can add the following System Flow:

```yaml
id: audit_log_cleanup
namespace: system
tasks:
  - id: purge_audit_logs
    type: io.kestra.plugin.ee.core.log.PurgeAuditLogs
    endDate: "{{ now() | dateAdd(-1, 'MONTHS') }}"
```

Combining the System Flows functionality with the new `PurgeAuditLogs` task provides a simple yet powerful way to manage your audit logs, ensuring you keep them as long as you need to stay compliant while keeping your database clean and performant.

## Plugin Enhancements

This release comes with several useful improvements across our plugin ecosystem.

First, we’ve [simplified](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-jdbc/issues/374) our **JDBC tasks and triggers** by introducing a single `fetchType` property, cleaning up what used to be a confusing set of options like `store`, `fetch`, and `fetchOne`.

For those working with **Apache Airflow** or gradually migrating away from it, you can now [orchestrate Airflow DAGs](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-airflow/issues/2) directly from Kestra. Similarly, **Azure Data Factory pipelines** can now be triggered from within a [new Azure plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-azure/issues/134), allowing better integration with your Azure workflows.

On the Google Cloud front, we’ve added the ability to create and delete **Dataproc clusters** with our [new GCP plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-gcp/pull/433).

We’ve also introduced a few new plugins for popular open-source technologies:
- [MySQL Batch Insert](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-jdbc/pull/358) task
- [NATS KV Store](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-nats/issues/46) tasks
- [MeiliSearch](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-meilisearch) tasks
- [DataHub](https://develop.kestra.io/plugins/plugin-datahub) ingestion task
- [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-notifications/issues/160) notification tasks (thanks [kriko](https://github.com/kriko)!)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-mongodb/pull/15) trigger.

For Java enthusiasts, the [JBang plugin](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2150) now lets you run [JBang scripts](https://develop.kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-jbang) directly from Kestra with support for Java, JShell, Kotlin, and Groovy.

We've also added a new **Excel plugin** to [read from and write to multiple sheets](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-serdes/issues/91), making it easier to export data from multiple sources into a single Excel file that can be used by business stakeholders.

The SSH Command plugin has been updated to [support OpenSSH config authentication](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-fs/pull/154/files).

Finally, we’ve [updated](https://github.com/kestra-io/plugin-docker/issues/32) the Docker `Push` task to support a `protocol` — an Enum-type property that allows pushing images to private registries using either HTTPS (default) or HTTP.

## Other Enhancements

### Schedule for Later

Starting from Kestra 0.19.0, [you can schedule any flow](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3818) to run at a specific date and time in the future. You can configure that directly using the `Advanced configuration` option in the `Execute` modal.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DSLNd7L3LR4?si=1hhh5b8tWQDXA5bh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

You can type the desired date directly, or use the date picker and click on the `Execute` button.

![execute_later](/blogs/release-0-19/execute_later.png)

That execution will be shown in the `CREATED` state and will only move into the `RUNNING` state at the scheduled date. You can see the scheduled date in the created Execution's `Overview` page:

![execute_later2](/blogs/release-0-19/execute_later2.png)

If you prefer a programmatic approach, you can also schedule execution for later using one of the following methods:
1. An API call
2. The new `scheduleDate` property of the `Subflow` task
3. The new `ScheduleOnDates` trigger.

The API call would look as follows:

```shell
curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    -F 'user=Scheduled Flow' \
    'http://localhost:28080/api/v1/executions/tutorial/hello_world?scheduleDate=2024-10-04T14:00:00.000000%2B02:00'
```

::alert{type="info"}
Note that the time zone offset like `+02:00` in the date `2024-12-24T17:00:00+02:00` needs to be URL-encoded. In URLs, the `+` sign is interpreted as a space, so it must be encoded as `%2B`. Therefore, the `+02:00` time zone offset would be URL-encoded as `%2B02:00` when passing the date and time in a URL.
::

Here is how the `Subflow` task would look:

```yaml
id: parent
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: subflow
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow
    namespace: company.team
    flowId: myflow
    scheduleDate: "{{now() | dateAdd(1, 'MINUTES')}}"
    wait: false

  - id: next_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Next task after the subflow
```

Assuming this child flow `myflow` is a long-running flow, the parent flow will not wait for it to finish (due to `wait: false`) and will continue executing other tasks. This is particularly useful when you want to schedule the subflow to run in the background when the right time comes and continue with other tasks in the parent flow.

::collapse{title="Example of a long-running child flow scheduled from a parent flow"}
```yaml
id: myflow
namespace: company.team
tasks:
  - id: sleep
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - sleep 90
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
```
::

The scheduled execution will be `CREATED`, and will transition into the `RUNNING` state at the `scheduleDate` — you can inspect all details including that scheduled date from the Overview page of that Execution.

If you have multiple dates to schedule, you can combine the `Subflow` task with the `ForEach` task to create multiple scheduled executions in the future — useful especially if the dates are retrieved from an external source or calculated based on some internal business logic — see the example below.

::collapse{title="Example of scheduling multiple flows using Python, Subflow, and ForEach tasks"}
```yaml
id: schedule_subflows
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: generate_dates
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Script
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install pytz
    script: |
      from datetime import datetime, timedelta
      import pytz
      import random
      from kestra import Kestra

      def generate_random_date():
          start = datetime.now()
          end = start + timedelta(weeks=1)

          random_date = start + (end - start) * random.random()
          timezone = pytz.FixedOffset(120)  # 120 minutes = 2 hours
          random_date = random_date.astimezone(timezone)
          return random_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")

      execution_dates = sorted([generate_random_date() for _ in range(10)])
      Kestra.outputs(dict(execution_dates=execution_dates))

  - id: each
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.ForEach
    values: "{{ outputs.generate_dates.vars.execution_dates }}"
    concurrencyLimit: 0
    tasks:
      - id: subflow
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Subflow
        namespace: company.team
        flowId: myflow
        scheduleDate: "{{ taskrun.value }}"
        wait: false
```
::

Finally, you can also use the new `ScheduleOnDates` trigger to start a flow at specific dates known ahead of time. This trigger is useful when you know the exact dates when you want to start the flow:

```yaml
id: scheduled_at
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: print_date
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: Hello at {{ trigger.date }}

triggers:
  - id: schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.ScheduleOnDates
    timezone: Europe/Berlin
    recoverMissedSchedules: LAST
    dates:
      - 2024-12-24T17:00:00+02:00 # Christmas Eve
      - 2024-12-25T17:00:00+02:00 # Christmas Day
      - 2024-12-31T17:00:00+02:00 # New Year's Eve
      - 2025-01-01T17:00:00+02:00 # New Year's Day
      - "{{now() | dateAdd(1, 'HOURS')}}"
      - "{{now() | dateAdd(2, 'DAYS')}}"
      - "{{now() | dateAdd(3, 'WEEKS')}}"
      - "{{now() | dateAdd(4, 'MONTHS')}}"
```

We look forward to seeing what you will build with these new Schedule-for-later enhancements! Here’s how a [community member reacted](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3818#issuecomment-2330205741) to this feature:

> "This is a game changer for me. I have jobs that need to be run whose schedule time and date can only be derived as a delta from a specific event. This would allow me to calculate the runs for the week, and schedule the jobs that need to run!"

Let us know how you plan to use these scheduling enhancements to make your flows (literally) future-proof.

### Concurrency Flow Tab

The new `Concurrency` tab in the `Flow` UI page allows you to track and troubleshoot concurrency issues. [This new tab](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4721#event-14422957135) shows a progress bar with the number of active slots compared to the total number of slots available. Below that progress bar, you can see a table showing currently running and queued Executions, providing a clear overview of the flow's concurrency status.

![concurrency_page_1](/blogs/release-0-19/concurrency_page_1.png)

To see the concurrency behavior in action, you can configure a flow with a concurrency limit as follows:

```yaml
id: concurrent
namespace: company.team

concurrency:
  behavior: QUEUE
  limit: 5

tasks:
  - id: long_running_task
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.shell.Commands
    commands:
      - sleep 90
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
```

Then trigger multiple Executions of that flow and watch the `Concurrency` tab showing the active slots and queued Executions.

![concurrency_page_2](/blogs/release-0-19/concurrency_page_2.png)


---

### URL to Follow the Execution Progress

The Executions endpoint now [returns a URL](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4256) allowing users to follow the Execution progress from the UI. This is particularly helpful for externally triggered long-running executions that require users to follow the workflow progress. Check the [Executions](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/execution#get-url-to-follow-the-execution-progress) documentation for a hands-on example.

---

### Smaller Improvements

- The webhook trigger page now [displays the webhook URL](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3891) so that you can easily copy it and use it in external applications that trigger your flows.
- The duration type property is now [much easier to set from the UI](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/3710) thanks to the new (beautiful!) UI component.
- We [now show a warning](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/2126) when you use `{{trigger.uri}}` and try to run the flow via the Execute button. This prevents accidental execution of flows that rely on data passed from external triggers.
- You can [manually change](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4447) the Execution state when needed, e.g., setting some failed executions to success after fixing the issue manually.
- We've [improved the memory consumption](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra-ee/issues/1262) of the Purge task to help in cases where you need to purge large amounts of data.
- We've [also improved](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra/issues/4631) handling of the Execution context, allowing you to set a limit on message size. When exceeded, the message will be refused by the queue, and the taskrun will fail with an error: `"Message of size XXX has exceeded the configured limit of XXX"`.
