Today, we are thrilled to announce Kestra's Realtime Triggers, an innovative feature that sets a new standard for orchestration. This powerful feature provides everything to build and operationalize business-critical workflows in real-time, including powerful, millisecond-latency integrations with messaging systems (Kafka, Pulsar, AMQP, MQTT, AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Event Hubs, NATS, Redis) and SQL databases. 

With Realtime Triggers, you can react to events as they happen and automate any business process instantly. Additionally, Kestra simplifies the configuration and management of these workflows, making it an ideal choice for developers and business users.

## Addressing Real-Time Challenges

Traditional data orchestration solutions are not equipped to deal with the demands of real-time processing. Reacting to changes in your data or application states requires maintaining complex, memory-inefficient, and brittle sensors polling external systems for their current state. Despite the operational maintenance nightmare, those processes are too slow to be applied to common applications like fraud detection and real-time recommendations. The latency introduced by these tools can result in missed opportunities and potential losses.

### How Kestra Solves These Problems

Kestra’s Realtime Triggers address these challenges head-on. By offering seamless integration with a wide array of external systems, Kestra eliminates the need for custom sensors, reducing maintenance efforts and ensuring that data flows smoothly across your tech stack. This capability allows businesses to focus on their core operations rather than dealing with the complexities of data integration.

Real-time triggers ensure immediate response to events. Whether detecting suspicious transactions or making instant recommendations, Kestra’s real-time processing capabilities guarantee that workflows are executed the moment an event occurs, maintaining high standards of service and operational efficiency.

Kestra also provides full observability into all workflow executions. This means that users can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their workflows in real time, ensuring that any issues are identified and resolved promptly. This level of visibility is crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of critical business processes.

Simplifying the setup process, Kestra uses intuitive API-first configurations that reduce both the time and complexity associated with deploying real-time workflows. This approach lets users quickly define their triggers and get their workflows up and running without the steep learning curve often associated with other tools.

## Advanced Capabilities with Realtime Triggers

Kestra’s Realtime Triggers represent a shift towards a more responsive, efficient, and integrated approach to data automation. Here are some of the advanced capabilities that set Kestra apart:

**Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium**

Debezium captures database changes in real-time, allowing Kestra to trigger workflows immediately upon detecting data modifications. This ensures that your data is always up-to-date and consistent across systems.

**Outbox Pattern Implementation**

Kestra supports the outbox pattern, ensuring reliable message delivery in microservice architectures. By monitoring outbox tables for new entries, Kestra’s Realtime Triggers can initiate workflows as soon as messages are ready, ensuring consistency and reliability in message-driven systems.

**Microservice Orchestration**

Coordinate complex microservice interactions in real-time with Kestra. Realtime Triggers enable workflows to respond instantly to events occurring across microservices, maintaining system synchronization and enhancing responsiveness.

**Efficient Message Consumption**

With Kestra’s ability to consume messages from various messaging systems in real-time, software engineers can create workflows that immediately process incoming messages, reducing latency and improving the responsiveness of applications.

## Unified Batch and Real-Time Processing 

Whether you’re processing data in **batch or real-time**, Kestra provides fine-grained visibility into the health of your platform. You can batch real-time data into a staging area, like a data lake, before loading it into your data warehouse, ensuring that both real-time and batch needs are met. 

With Kestra, you can **lower latency** for reporting and analytics, transitioning seamlessly from batch to real-time as your needs evolve. Unlike complex orchestration systems that require extensive sensor setup and complex deployment processes, Kestra’s **intuitive design** and **simple configuration** mean you can get started in minutes.

## Simplified Real-Time Automation for All Engineers

Kestra’s Realtime Triggers provide a powerful yet simple solution to complex automation challenges. Developers can enjoy advanced capabilities tailored to technical needs, while business users benefit from the ease of configuration and management. Kestra bridges the gap between simplicity and power, ensuring that workflows are not only performant but also easy to implement and maintain.

## The Impact of Kestra’s Realtime Triggers

With Kestra’s Realtime Triggers, businesses can:
- React to business-critical events instantly
- Maintain seamless integration across diverse systems
- Achieve full visibility into workflow executions for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting of everything happening in your business
- Simplify the configuration and management of real-time workflows, allowing faster deployment and reliable execution.
