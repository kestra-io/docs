**Today, we’re thrilled to announce a strategic partnership between [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) and [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) to simplify data workflows and accelerate time-to-delivery for data teams! This collaboration will empower data professionals to leverage the combined strengths of Kestra's declarative workflow engine and Dremio's Data lakehouse capabilities.**

## About Dremio

Dremio is a data lakehouse platform that simplifies big data analytics. It allows you to directly access data from various sources, such as Postgres, S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage, without needing to copy or move the data. Its key features include a fast query engine, a semantic layer to help manage and share data, a catalog for Iceberg tables, and reflections — a market-leading query acceleration technology that delivers sub-second query response times. Designed to work with SQL and common BI tools, Dremio provides self-service analytics and data management for BI workloads with the best price performance and lowest cost.

## Kestra's Integration with Dremio

Integrating Dremio with Kestra offers a powerful solution for analytical workflows and scenarios involving complex data transformations and business-critical operations.

Kestra provides a declarative workflow engine that orchestrates Dremio's data access and management capabilities. This allows data professionals to build complex workflows without intricate coding, while easily querying data directly from various sources through Dremio's lakehouse architecture. 

Together, we reduce unnecessary coding overhead and eliminate the need for complex ETL pipelines. The intuitive interfaces focus on the user experience, and the rich plugin ecosystems of both tools further amplify their synergy, accelerating development cycles and empowering data professionals to deliver insights faster.

### Practical Application of the Kestra-Dremio Integration

As part of our partnership, we've recently launched the Dremio and Arrow Flight SQL plugins to orchestrate your data lakehouse workflows. These plugins empower users to automate complex data processes, including:

- Trigger a workflow when there is an anomaly in the Dremio database or when certain KPIs fall outside of an expected range.
- Run SQL queries against Dremio databases to fetch data for downstream processing in Python, R, or other languages supported by Kestra.
- Query data from Dremio and process it in a Python script


## What's Next

Kestra and Dremio can help data practitioners to be more productive by simplifying data access, automating data workflows, and improving data quality.
